Abstract
  This trial assessed the effects of two doses of clonidine compared with placebo on the quality and speed of recovery in children premedicated with oral midazolam and anaesthetised with sevoflurane for cataract surgery. One hundred and twenty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to II children (aged one to six years), premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg and undergoing elective unilateral cataract surgery with sevoflurane anaesthesia were studied. Children were randomised to intravenous clonidine 1 mug/kg (group C1, n=39), 2 mug/kg (group C2, n=41) or normal saline (group NS, n=40). Clinically successful sub-Tenon local anaesthesia block was required for a patient to be included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative agitation. Postoperative agitation was defined as a Pain Discomfort Score of >=3 using items 3 to 5 only, which was assessed 15 minutely until discharge. Agitation was observed in 11/40 (27.5%) children in the NS group compared to 2/39 (5.1%) in group C1 and none in group C2 (P <0.001). Rescue medication to treat severe agitation was required in 5/40 (12.5%) in the NS group, 1/39 (2.6%) in group C1 and none in group C2 (P=0.025). Time to meet discharge criteria was significantly shorter in group C1 compared to the other two groups (48.4+/-14.0 minutes compared to C2 79.5+/-12.8 minutes and NS 73.1+/-20.4 minutes, P <0.001). There were no significant effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Intravenous clonidine 1 mug/kg is effective for reducing agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia and midazolam premedication in children undergoing cataract surgery. Intravenous clonidine 2 mug/kg was also effective and for a longer period, but was associated with a longer time to discharge.

Abstract
  Background. Caudal anaesthesia is a common procedure for infants and children undergoing subumbilical surgery, mostly performed in conjunction with general anaesthesia. Even if complications are rare, the risk of postoperative apnoea is significant, especially in infants born preterm or operated upon before 46 weeks of post-conceptual age. Caudal block in sedated, spontaneously breathing patients might be a safe alternative. Methods. We investigated 512 infants and children. Premedication consisted of midazolam, sedation was induced with i.v. nalbuphine 0.1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and propofol 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, and maintained with propofol 5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> in children, if necessary. Caudal block was performed with ropivacaine 1 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> (0.2% or 0.35%).Results. Data were obtained from 228 infants and 284 children. Median (IQR) age was 1.3 (0.2, 3.4) yr; median body weight was 10.0 (4.8, 15.3) kg. Two hundred and thirty-three (45.51) were born preterm and 47 (9.18%) were operated upon before 46 weeks of post-conceptual age. Caudal block was successful in 98.05 and adverse events occurred in 7.03% patients. The incidence of adverse events was not higher in born preterm or operated upon before 46 weeks of post-conceptual age than in term born infants (P=0.35 and 0.35, respectively), or in infants vs children (P=0.61). There was no correlation between the incidence of adverse events and continuous sedation (P=0.07), coexisting diseases (P=0.11), or ASA classification (P=0.33).Conclusions. Caudal anaesthesia under sedation is associated with high success rates and a low incidence of adverse events, but requires careful and anticipatory perioperative management.  2010 The Author.

Abstract
  The aim of the present study was to compare clinical effects of oral midazolam and clonidine premedication in children. In a prospective randomized double blind trial, 45 children between 2-8 years old received either oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (group M) or clonidine at 2 microg/kg (group C 2) or 4 microg/kg (group C4). The level of sedation, quality of parental separation, mask acceptance and thermodynamics were recorded. Postoperative analgesia, and perioperative side effects were assessed. In comparison to group M, the scores of sedation, parental separation and mask acceptance were significantly higher in group C2 and group C4 (p < 0.05). Also the level of sedation was significantly better in group C 4 than in group C 2 (p < 0.05). However, the rate of postoperative analgesia decreased significantly in group C 2 and C 4 compared to group M. The incidence of shivering was significantly increased in group M compared to group C 2 and C 4 . Oral clonidine premedication can therefore provide better preoperative sedation and postoperative analgesia with few adverse effects.

Abstract
  Background: Clonidine is used increasingly in pediatric anesthesia practice to prolong the duration of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent. Which route of administration of clonidine is the most beneficial remains unknown. We compared the effects of caudal and intravenous clonidine on postoperative analgesia produced by caudal levobupivacaine. Methods: Sixty ASA I and II children, aged 2-8 undergoing inguinal hernia repair or orchidopexy surgery received standardized premedication with midazolam and general anesthesia. The children were randomized in a double-blind fashion to three groups. Group L (n = 20) patients received 0.75 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> of caudal 0.25% levobupivacaine and i.v. 5 ml saline, Group L-Ccau (n = 20) patients received 0.75 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> of caudal 0.25% levobupivacaine + 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> clonidine and i.v. 5 ml saline, Group L-Civ (n = 20) patients received 0.75 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> of caudal 0.25% levobupivacaine and i.v. 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> clonidine in 5 ml of saline. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide values were recorded. Postoperative pain [Children and Infants Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) score], sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale) and motor blockade (Modified Bromage Scale) were assessed at predetermined time points during the first 24 h after surgery. Results: Caudal clonidine significantly delayed the time to first rescue analgesic and fewer patients required rescue analgesia in the 24 h after surgery. No motor block was observed in any of the three groups on awakening or during the study period. In Group L-Ccau, the CHIPPS score was lower than in Group L at all times through 240 min (P < 0.05), while the pain scores were lower in Group L-Civ only at extubation and at 240 min (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Caudal clonidine prolongs the duration of analgesia produced by caudal levobupivacaine without causing significant side effects and this is because of a spinal mode of action.  2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Abstract
  Background: Premedication is considered important in pediatric anesthesia. Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used premedication agents. Clonidine, an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, is gaining popularity among anesthesiologists. The goal of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis of studies comparing premedication with clonidine to Benzodiazepines. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify clinical trials focusing on the comparison of clonidine and Benzodiazepines for premedication in children. Six reviewers independently assessed each study to meet the inclusion criteria and extracted data. Original data from each trial were combined to calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) or the mean differences (MD), 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] and statistical heterogeneity were accessed. Results: Ten publications fulfilling the inclusion criteria were found. Premedication with clonidine, in comparison with midazolam, exhibited a superior effect on sedation at induction (OR=0.49 [0.27, 0.89]), decreased the incidence of emergence agitation (OR=0.25 [0.11, 0.58]) and produced a more effective early post-operative analgesia (OR=0.33 [0.21, 0.58]). Compared with diazepam, clonidine was superior in preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Discussion: Premedication with clonidine is superior to midazolam in producing sedation, decreasing post-operative pain and emergence agitation. However, the superiority of clonidine for PONV prevention remains unclear while other factors such as nausea prevention might interfere with this result.  2010 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Abstract
  Mather & Mackie1 reported in 1983 that 40% of paediatric surgical patients had moderate to severe postoperative pain and 75% had received insufficient pain treatment. Since then a range of effective and safe techniques have been developed and a multi-modal approach to paediatric pain has been implemented in many hospitals, where acute pain services for children have been established. Treatment is based on five groups of analgesics: Opioids. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Paracetamol (acetaminophen). Nitrous oxide. Local anaesthetics. Analgesics for systemic use. The same selection of drugs as are used in adults for analgesia can be used in infants and children. Due to changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during early life dosing guidelines are different and should be age adjusted. Metabolic pathways for many drugs are maturing in early life and the proportions of drugs being metabolised through different routes change markedly during this time. Sulphation in the liver is efficient in the early neonatal period, whereas glucuronidation matures later (paracetamol and morphine). Pharmacogenetics is becoming increasingly important as illustrated by a case report where polymorphism of CYP2D6 in a mother proved to be life threatening for her breastfed baby when she was given codeine in the immediate post partum period. Polymorphisms at the genes ABCB1/ MDR1 and OPRM1 have also been shown to be of importance for the effects of morphine. Opioids Neonates have impaired capacity to metabolise and eliminate morphine. In the first weeks of life mature neonates have a clearance of morphine about one-third that of older infants and elimination half-life approximately 1.7 times longer, but morphine clearance in mature infants above the age of 1 month is at the level of older children. Continuous infusions have gained considerable popularity and with a dosing between 10 and 30 mg/kg/h adequate analgesia can often be provided with an acceptable level of side effects. Opioid infusion techniques such as continuous infusion, PCA and NCA seem to have about the frequency of severe critical incidents as epidural techniques. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are important in the treatment and prevention of mild or moderate pain and NSAIDs are effective in combination with a local or regional nerve block. NSAIDs are often used in combination with opioids and have in most studies been shown to have an opioid sparing effect in the order of 30%. This may reduce opioid-related adverse effects and NSAIDs in combination with paracetamol have a synergistic analgesic effect. NSAIDs have a ceiling effect. The use of NSAIDs after tonsillectomy has been an ongoing controversy. There is no doubt about the efficacy of the analgesia provided by NSAIDs but there are concerns about increased risk of posttonsillectomy bleeding. Animal studies have shown impaired bone healing in the presence of NSAIDs. For most paediatric orthopaedic surgery, the benefits of short-term perioperative use of NSAIDs outweigh the risks but the use of NSAIDs is generally not recommended in fusion operations, limblengthening procedures, and in patients where bone healing has been difficult. Paracetamol. There is evidence that paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus probably via inhibition of cycloxygenase-3. This central action produces both antipyretic as well as analgesic effects. The analgesic potency of paracetamol is relatively low and dose-related with a ceiling effect. On its own, it can be used to treat or prevent most mild and moderate pain. In combination with either NSAIDs or codeine, it can be used for moderate pain. Paracetamol is rapidly and reliably absorbed from the small bowel so whenever possible oral administration should be used. Suppositories vary in their composition and bioavailability, with lipophilic formulations having higher bioavailability. Absorption from the rectum is slow and incomplete, except in neonates. Solubilized paracetamol (Perfalgan) has become available for i.v. use in children above the age of 1 year and intravenous administration seems to result in a better analgesic effect. Dosing regimens for paracetamol have been revised in the last few years on the basis of age, route of administration, loading dose, maintenance dose, and duration of therapy to ensure a reasonable balance between efficacy and safety. In younger infants, sick children, and the preterm neonate, downward dose adjustments are needed. Nitrous oxide for procedural pain. A mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (Entonox or Medimix) has become increasingly popular for sedation and analgesia in children. It is used during painful procedures such as lumbar puncture, suture of a wound, puncture of knee or elbow, removal of drain, change of dressing, injections of botox, intravenous access etc. The following criteria should be applied when using nitrous oxide: The child should be more than 3 to 4-years old The child must be able to understand a simple explanation of the procedure The child must be cooperative and accept a mask The child should not have eaten a major meal within the last 4 h. No obvious contraindications such as increased intracranial pressure, pneumothorax, sinusitis, decreased level of consciousness etc. When appropriate nitrous oxide can be supplemented with a local anaesthetic crme or an injection of local anaesthesia. In most cases the provider of the nitrous oxide also distracts the child be telling a story or go for a 'magical tour'. Local and regional anaesthesia Regional anaesthesia produces excellent postoperative analgesia and the central blocks may modify the stress response in infants and children. However, problems with the routine use of epidurals have in some places reduced the use of epidurals in children. A large prospective 1-year survey in France of more than 24 000 paediatric regional anaesthetic blocks found an overall incidence of complications of 0.9 in 1000 blocks, with no complications when using peripheral techniques. Complications were transient and half of them seemed to be related to use of inappropriate equipment. The most common problems in regional anaesthesia in children are failure to establish a proper block or postoperative failure of maintaining the block. The more serious complications such as infections, peripheral nerve injury, local anaesthetic toxicity, and serious adverse effects of opioids are much more rare. Topical local anaesthetic techniques. The use of EMLA (Eutetic mixture of local anaesthetics) has been established for many years and a similar crme with tetracaine (amethocaine) (Ametop) is also very efficient. Tetracaine is an ester local anaesthetic and since the esterase systems in tissues, plasma, and red blood cells are mature in early life makes it particularly useful in neonates. Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthetic techniques The use of ultrasound allows visualization of anatomical structures, guides the advancing needle and shows the spread of the local anaesthetic solution. This provides an effective block using less local anaesthetic solution. Ultrasound guided technique may be combined with the use of a stimulating needle and a nerve stimulator. Continuous catheter techniques are becoming popular in children for femoral, brachial plexus, fascia iliaca, lumbar plexus, and sciatic blockade. Adjuvants to local anaesthetics. Addition of clonidine or ketamine to a single injection bolus of local anaesthetic potentiates and prolongs the analgesic effect of caudal blocks. It was demonstrated that postoperative analgesia after caudal block lasted longer without significant side effects, when Sketamine 0.5 mg/kg was added to 0.2% ropivacaine compared with clonidine 2 mug/kg with ropivacaine or plain ropivacaine. Caudally administered S-ketamine (1 mg/kg) combined with 1 or 2 mug/kg of clonidine was shown to provide significantly longer postoperative analgesia than S-ketamine alone. The risk of respiratory depression when using clonidine and ketamine is negligible compared with the use opioids. However, apnoea has been reported in a former preterm infant after caudal bupivacaine with clonidine, and clonidine is probably best avoided in preterm or expreterm infants up to 60 weeks postconceptional age. The safety of neuraxial ketamine has been debated with regard to spinal cord toxicity, but considering the current literature, a single bolus administration of preservative-free S-ketamine seems to be safe. Conclusions The means and techniques for safe prevention and control of moderate and severe postoperative pain in all children whatever their age, severity of illness, or surgical procedure are available. The main task is to organize and implement the present knowledge in all children. Continuing pain control at home after day-case surgery is important. The safety of analgesic therapy has improved partly with the development of new drugs but mainly by a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of well-known drugs in neonates, infants and children, and in disease states. The present knowledge should be implemented at all levels of the health care system. In more complex cases, management by a multidisciplinary acute pain team with paediatric expertise is the most effective approach.

The safety of analgesic therapy has improved partly with the development of new drugs but mainly by a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of well-known drugs in neonates, infants and children, and in disease states. The present knowledge should be implemented at all levels of the health care system. In more complex cases, management by a multidisciplinary acute pain team with paediatric expertise is the most effective approach.

Abstract
  Various drugs have been used as adjunct to caudal bupivacaine for postoperative pain relief in paediatric patients with variable results. This randomized prospective study was designed to assess and compare the efficacy of clonidine and neostigmine used as an adjunct to bupivacaine for caudal analgesia in paediatric patients. Seventy five patients undergoing elective inguinal herniotomy were included in one of the three following groups. Group B patients received 1 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine caudally. Group C patients received 1 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine and 1 mug/kg clonidine. Patients of group N were given1 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine and 2 mug/kg neostigmine. Postoperative analgesia was assessed by CRIES scale. The mean duration of analgesia was 5.92+/-0.6 hours in group B, 11.17+/-0.88 hours in group C and 13.16+/-0.46 hours in group N. The prolongation of duration of analgesia was significant in both Group C and N in comparison to group B. Occurrence of adverse effects was statistically insignificant among the three groups. The addition of both clonidine and neostigmine with bupivacaine administered caudally significantly increases the duration of analgesia. However, neostigmine causes more prolonged analgesia than clonidine.

Abstract
  Background: Propofol is a popular agent for providing procedural sedation in pediatric population during lumbar puncture and spinal anesthesia. Adjuvants like clonidine and fentanyl are administered intrathecally to prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia and to provide postoperative analgesia. We studied the propofol requirement after intrathecal administration of clonidine or fentanyl in infants undergoing lower abdominal surgeries. Methods: Sixty-five ASA I infants undergoing elective lower abdominal surgery under spinal anesthesia were assigned into four groups in this prospective randomized double-blinded study. Group B received bupivacaine based on body weight (<5 kg = 0.5 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>; 5-10 kg = 0.4 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>). Group BC received 1 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup> of clonidine with bupivacaine, group BF received 1 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup> of fentanyl with bupivacaine, and patients in group BCF received 1 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup> each of clonidine and fentanyl with bupivacaine. A bolus of 2-3 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> of propofol bolus was administered for lumbar puncture. Sedation was assessed using a six-point sedation score (0-5) and a five-point reactivity score (0-4) which was based on a behavioral score. After achieving a sedation and reactivity score of 3-4, the patients were placed lateral in knee chest position and lumbar puncture performed and test drug administered. Further intraoperative sedation was maintained with an infusion of 25-50 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup>.<sup>-1</sup> of propofol infusion. Results: The mean +/- sd infusion requirement of propofol decreased from 35.5 +/- 4.5 in group B to 33.4 +/- 5.4 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup>.<sup>-1</sup> in group BF and further decreased to 16.7 +/- 6.2 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup>.<sup>-1</sup> and 14.8 +/- 4.9 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup>.<sup>-1</sup> in group BC and BCF, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between BC and BCF groups. The mean sedation and reactivity scores were higher in groups BC and BCF when compared to groups B and BF. Conclusion: Our study show that the requirement of propofol sedation reduces with intrathecal adjuvants. The reduction was significant with the addition of clonidine and clonidine-fentanyl combination as opposed to bupivacaine alone or with fentanyl. There was no significant difference in propofol infusion requirement with the use of bupivacaine alone or with fentanyl.  2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Abstract
  Backgrounds: Sevoflurane is widely employed for inhalational induction in children. Clonidine deepens volatile anesthetics and reduces several types of MAC of sevoflurane. Laryngeal mask airway is a useful device for pediatric anesthesia. The aim of the current study was to determine whether oral clonidine premedication can reduce MAC of sevoflurane for an LMA insertion in children. Methods: Fifty-six ASA physical status I patients (3-11 years) scheduled for general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups of 28 patients each. One group (clonidine group) received clonidine 4 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> approximately 100 min before anesthesia, and the other (control) group did not. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane. Each concentration of sevoflurane, at which an LMA insertion was attempted, was predetermined according to the modification of Dixon's up-and-down method with 0.25% as a step size and held constant for at least 20 min before the trial. All responses ('movement' or 'no movement') to an LMA insertion were assessed. Results: Minimum alveolar concentration values of sevoflurane for an LMA insertion were lower in the clonidine group (1.31% +/- 0.18% [mean +/- SD]) than in the control group (2.00% +/- 0.16%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that sevoflurane EC95 values were 1.79% and 2.49% in the clonidine and control groups, respectively. Conclusions: Oral clonidine premedication reduced the MAC (EC50) and EC95 values of sevoflurane for LMA insertion by 38% and 28%, respectively.  2006 The Authors.

Abstract
  The administration of epidural opioids, though effective for producing analgesia, has severe side effects in most patients. It is unknown whether clonidine can effectively replace opioids and cause fewer side effects. We compared, in this randomized trial, the incidence of vomiting and pruritus as well as the analgesic profile of three different combinations of bupivacaine, fentanyl, and clonidine administered epidurally in patients undergoing the Nuss procedure: bupivacaine + fentanyl, bupivacaine + clonidine, bupivacaine + fentanyl + clonidine. The incidence of side effects was significantly less in the bupivacaine + clonidine group (33%) compared with the bupivacaine + fentanyl (92%) and bupivacaine + fentanyl + clonidine (73%) groups (P = 0.004). Quality of postoperative analgesia was similar in the three groups. No significant complications were observed. In conclusion, clonidine is an effective and safe alternative to epidural opioids.

Abstract
  Background: Oral premedication is widely used in pediatric anesthesia to reduce preoperative anxiety and ensure smooth induction. Midazolam is currently the most commonly used premedicant, but good results have also been reported with clonidine. The aim of the present study was to compare clinical effects of oral midazolam and oral clonidine. Methods: We performed a prospective open study in 64 children who were randomly assigned to receive either oral midazolam 0.5 mgkg <sup>-1</sup> (group M) or oral clonidine 4 mugkg <sup>-1</sup> (group C) prior to mask induction. Drug acceptance, preoperative sedation and anxiolysis, quality of mask acceptance, recovery profile and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Results: The taste of oral clonidine was judged as significantly better; 14% of children rejected oral midazolam. Onset of sedation was significantly faster after premedication with midazolam (30 +/- 13.1 min) than with clonidine (38.5 +/- 14.6 min), but level of sedation was significantly better after premedication with clonidine. Quality of mask induction was equally successful in both groups. A steal-induction was performed in 66% of patients of group C, but none in group M. We observed a trend towards an increased incidence of emergence agitation after premedication with midazolam. Parental satisfaction was significantly higher in group C. Conclusions: In this study, premedication with oral clonidine appeared to be superior to oral midazolam. Quality of mask acceptance was comparable between groups, but oral clonidine was better accepted by the child, produced more effective preoperative sedation, showed a trend towards better recovery from anesthesia and had a higher degree of parental satisfaction.  2007 The Authors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Midazolam is the most commonly used premedication in children. It has been shown to be more effective than parental presence or placebo in reducing anxiety and improving compliance at induction of anesthesia. Clonidine, an alpha(2) agonist, has been suggested as an alternative. Dexmedetomidine is a more alpha(2) selective drug with more favorable pharmacokinetic properties than clonidine. We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate whether intranasal dexmedetomidine is as effective as oral midazolam for premedication in children. METHODS: Ninety-six children of ASA physical status I or II scheduled for elective minor surgery were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group M received midazolam 0.5 mg/kg in acetaminophen syrup and intranasal placebo. Group D0.5 and Group D1 received intranasal dexmedetomidine 0.5 or 1 microg/kg, respectively, and acetaminophen syrup. Patients' sedation status, behavior scores, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded by an observer until induction of anesthesia. Recovery characteristics were also recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in parental separation acceptance, behavior score at induction and wake-up behavior score. When compared with group M, patients in group D0.5 and D1 were significantly more sedated when they were separated from their parents (P < 0.001). Patients from group D1 were significantly more sedated at induction of anesthesia when compared with group M (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal dexmedetomidine produces more sedation than oral midazolam, but with similar and acceptable cooperation.

Abstract
  In this study, we examined the effect of clonidine added to local anaesthetics on the duration of post-operative analgesia in caudal anaesthesia in children. In a prospective randomized study (Apr.08 -Aug.08) we recorded 76 children (ASA physical status I-II, age 1 month 12 years) scheduled for subumbilical surgery. Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia Were performed by inhalation of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide through a face mask. The caudal anesthesia were performed with 1ml/ kg (0,25% Chirocaine, 0,1% Lidocaine and 1mkg/kg Clonidine). Intraoperative monitoring observed the mean blood pressure, heart rate and pulse oximetry; postoperative monitoring included a Behavioural Observational Pain Scale (BOPS), Wong-Baker pain scale, visual analogue scale (VAS) and four degree sedation scale. The efficacy of postoperative analgesia and sedation were documented till 8 postoperative hour. Peri-operative hypotension, brudycardia and post-operative respiratory depsession were not recorded in any patient. The average time of recovery was 10 minutes. Twenty (26%) children received additional analgesia. We evaluate our results as satisfactory regarding postoperative analgesia as the role of clonidine 1mkg/kg is still under question.

Abstract
  There has been considerable investment in services that promote the effective management of acute pain. Despite acute pain teams being normal practice in UK hospitals and an increasing volume of guidance, there are still a substantial number of patients who suffer moderate or severe acute pain. Acute pain teams improve analgesia, reduce side effects and improve safety on the basis of comparative studies. Simple scales for assessing pain are effective. Assessment may be more difficult in certain patient groups such as babies, infants and children, elderly patients and non-English speakers. Assessment for the symptoms and signs of neuropathic pain is important when nerve injury is suspected. Effective pain management obtunds the adverse effects of the injury response and may reduce the risk of chronic postsurgical pain. Preventive analgesia in terms of reducing postoperative pain and/or analgesic use is associated with the use of local anaesthetics, opioids or N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists. Paracetamol is an effective analgesic and lowers the number needed to treat of other analgesics. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is limited by side effects. Tramadol has important non-opioid mechanisms that widen its scope. In the future there will be a greater focus on those areas where current pain control approaches are of limited benefit.  2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Caudal blockade is a common technique for pediatric postoperative analgesia. While safe and effective, caudal opioids are associated with troublesome side effects. Caudal clonidine may offer significant analgesic benefits. We prospectively compared the analgesic, side effect, and rehabilitation profiles of caudal clonidine, hydromorphone, or morphine in a group of 60 pediatric patients undergoing ureteral reimplantation. METHODS: Patients aged 6 mo to 6 yr were evenly and randomly enrolled in a double-blind manner. Patients received a single caudal dose of 2 mcg/kg of clonidine, 10 mcg/kg of hydromorphone, or 50 mcg/kg of morphine, combined with 1.0 mL/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine with epinephrine. After sevoflurane in oxygen/air anesthesia, all subjects received proxy nurse-controlled analgesia with morphine. Postoperative pain intensity, use of IV morphine, and side effects were assessed during the first 24 h. Oral intake and discharge home were recorded. RESULTS: Caudal clonidine resulted in less postoperative nausea and vomiting (P = 0.01) and pruritus (P = 0.007) than did caudal hydromorphone or caudal morphine. Caudal morphine produced more sustained initial analgesia than did caudal clonidine (P = 0.02). No difference was observed in pain scores, total morphine use, time to first oral intake or discharge home. No postoperative respiratory depression, excessive sedation, hypotension, or bradycardia was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Although caudal morphine may result in more sustained initial analgesia, caudal clonidine combined with nurse-controlled analgesia appears to provide comparable analgesia with fewer side effects. Based on these results, the use of caudal clonidine may be superior to caudal opioids after pediatric ureteral reimplantation.  2007 by International Anesthesia Research Society.

Abstract
  Background. This randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that, in comparison with midazolam, premedication with oral clonidine reduces the incidence of emergence agitation in preschool children anaesthetized with sevoflurane. Methods. Sixty-eight ASA I-II children undergoing circumcision were randomized into three groups to receive different oral premedication given 30 min before anaesthesia: midazolam 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup>, and clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup>. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was administered via a facemask (O<sub>2</sub>/ N<sub>2</sub>O: 40/60). Analgesia was with penile block (bupivacaine 0.5% 0.3 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>) and rectal paracetamol (30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). During the first postoperative hour, children were evaluated using a modified 'objective pain scale'. Results. Only the 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> dose of clonidine was associated with a significant reduction in emergence agitation. Fewer children in the clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> group displayed agitation (25%) than in the midazolam group (60%) (P = 0.025). Incidence of hypotension and bradycardia, time to first micturition and first drink did not differ among groups. Conclusions. In comparison with midazolam, clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> reduced sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation without increasing postoperative side-effects.

Abstract
  Background: A growing interest in the possible influences of pre- and postoperative anxiety and pain scores as outcomes of surgical treatment and benefits of anxiety or pain-reducing interventions has emerged. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of three different premedication regimens on postoperative pain and anxiety in children. Methods: A prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial enrolled 60 schoolchildren. They were randomized for premedication with oral midazolam 0.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup>, oral clonidine 4 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>, or transmucosal dexmedetomidine (DEX) 1 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>, submitted to a pre- and postoperative evaluation of anxiety with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and asked to report any pain in verbal and visual analog scales. We also evaluated secondary outcomes such as parents' anxiety, sedation, separation from parents, adverse effects and hemodynamic status. Results: Dexmedetomidine and clonidine were related to lower scores of pain than midazolam. alpha<sub>2</sub>-agonists produced lower scores of peroperative mean arterial pressure and heart rate than midazolam. Both groups had similar levels of postoperative state-anxiety in children. There was no difference in preanesthesia levels of sedation and response to separation from parents between groups. Conclusions: These findings indicate that children receiving clonidine or DEX preoperatively have similar levels of anxiety and sedation postoperatively as those receiving midazolam. However, children given alpha<sub>2</sub>-agonists had less perioperative sympathetic stimulation and less postoperative pain than those given midazolam.  2007 The Authors.

Abstract
  Background: Clonidine premedication in children reliably provides preoperative sedation and anxiolysis, but onset of oral clonidine is known to be slow. Nasal clonidine has been shown to reach peak plasma levels within 10 min in rodents. The aim of the present study was to compare clinical effects and percentage of steal-induction after clonidine premedication by the oral and nasal route. Methods: Forty children, aged 1-6 years, scheduled for minor infraumbilical surgery, were randomly assigned to receive either pure clonidine 4 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> intranasally (group CN, n = 20) or clonidine 4 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> orally in syrup (group CO, n = 20) prior to mask induction. Drug acceptance, preoperative sedation and anxiolysis, quality of mask acceptance, recovery profile and parents' satisfaction were evaluated. Results: Drug acceptance was similar between groups, but quality of taste was significantly better in the oral group. There was no significant difference of preoperative anxiolysis and sedation. The onset of sedative effect was after 38.3 min for oral clonidine and 47.5 min for nasal clonidine. A steal-induction could be performed in 60% of children in each group. Emergence from anesthesia and parents' satisfaction were comparable. Conclusions: Intranasal clonidine administration has no advantage over the oral route. Clinical effects were similar with both routes; there was a trend towards a faster onset of sedation with oral clonidine. Clonidine premedication causes light sleep, which allows a steal-induction in 60% of patients.  2007 The Authors.

Abstract
  Objective: There has yet been no ideal method for postoperative analgesia in children. Ketamine demonstrates a potent analgesic effect by central blockage of perception of pain with sub-anesthetic doses. Preoperative intramuscular administration of ketamine for sedation decreases the pain during swallowing after tonsillectomy, while it provides long-term analgesia when applied around the incision. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ketamine administered to the tonsillar region following tonsillectomy for postoperative pain management. Methods: After obtaining consent from the local ethics committee and the parents, 60 patients from the ASA groups I and II, between 3 and 7 years of age, planned for adenotonsillectomy as outpatients, were included in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to two equal groups and 2 ml 0.9% saline for group S, and 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> ketamine and saline 2 ml in volume for group K were administered into the tonsillar region. All subjects were monitored in a standard manner and SpO<sub>2</sub>, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and cardiac pulse rates were recorded in 5 min intervals. The CHEOPS and Wilson sedation scale were used to evaluate pain levels and sedative condition, respectively. Nausea and vomiting scores of the subjects were also noted. The time of the first analgesic administration and the total amount of analgesics in an 8-hour period were recorded. Student-T and Chi-Square tests were used for the statistical evaluation of the data and a p value of <0.05 was accepted as significant. Results: There were no significant differences between groups according to age, sex, weight, intermittent SAP and cardiac pulse rates. However, the CHEOPS value, the first analgesic need and the total amount of analgesic need were in favor of ketamine (p < 0.05). Conclusions: In previous studies, no significant differences were demonstrated in pre-emptive analgesia with ketamine, magnesium, morphine, and clonidine. The dose of ketamin and the volume used in this study caused no sedation or nausea and provided a high level of analgesia. Ketamine infiltration into the tonsillar region after tonsillectomy was found to be easy and effective.  2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  The administration of epidural opioids, though effective for producing analgesia, has severe side effects in most patients. It is unknown whether clonidine can effectively replace opioids and cause fewer side effects. We compared, in this randomized trial, the incidence of vomiting and pruritus as well as the analgesic profile of three different combinations of bupivacaine, fentanyl, and clonidine administered epidurally in patients undergoing the Nuss procedure: bupivacaine + fentanyl, bupivacaine + clonidine, bupivacaine + fentanyl + clonidine. The incidence of side effects was significantly less in the bupivacaine + clonidine group (33%) compared with the bupivacaine + fentanyl (92%) and bupivacaine + fentanyl + clonidine (73%) groups (P = 0.004). Quality of postoperative analgesia was similar in the three groups. No significant complications were observed. In conclusion, clonidine is an effective and safe alternative to epidural opioids.

Abstract
  Backgrounds: Sevoflurane is widely employed for inhalational induction in children. Clonidine deepens volatile anesthetics and reduces several types of MAC of sevoflurane. Laryngeal mask airway is a useful device for pediatric anesthesia. The aim of the current study was to determine whether oral clonidine premedication can reduce MAC of sevoflurane for an LMA insertion in children. Methods: Fifty-six ASA physical status I patients (3-11 years) scheduled for general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups of 28 patients each. One group (clonidine group) received clonidine 4 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> approximately 100 min before anesthesia, and the other (control) group did not. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane. Each concentration of sevoflurane, at which an LMA insertion was attempted, was predetermined according to the modification of Dixon's up-and-down method with 0.25% as a step size and held constant for at least 20 min before the trial. All responses ('movement' or 'no movement') to an LMA insertion were assessed. Results: Minimum alveolar concentration values of sevoflurane for an LMA insertion were lower in the clonidine group (1.31% +/- 0.18% [mean +/- SD]) than in the control group (2.00% +/- 0.16%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that sevoflurane EC95 values were 1.79% and 2.49% in the clonidine and control groups, respectively. Conclusions: Oral clonidine premedication reduced the MAC (EC50) and EC95 values of sevoflurane for LMA insertion by 38% and 28%, respectively.  2006 The Authors.

Abstract
  This review systematically examines the literature on the ability of the classical epidural test dose and other strategies to detect intravascular, intrathecal, or subdural epidural needle/catheter misplacement. For detection of simulated intravascular misplacements, a sensitivity (S) and a positive predictive value (PPV) >=80 demonstrated by at least two randomized controlled trials coming from two different centers were determined for the following tests and patient populations: Nonpregnant adult patients = increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=15 mm Hg (S = 80-100 and 93-100; PPV = 80-100 and 83-100) or either an increase in SBP >=15 mm Hg or an increase in heart rate >=10 bpm after the injection of 10 (S = 100; PPV = 83-100) or 15 mug of epinephrine (S = 100; PPV = 83-100); pregnant patients = sedation, drowsiness, or dizziness within 5 min after the injection of 100 mug of fentanyl (S = 92-100; PPV = 91-95); and children = increase in SBP >=15 mm Hg after the injection of 0.5 mug/kg of epinephrine (S = 81-100; PPV = 100). Conversely, more studies are required to determine the best strategies to detect intrathecal and subdural epidural needle/catheter misplacements in these three patient populations. 2006 by the International Anesthesia Research Society.

Abstract
  Background: Spinal anesthesia (SA) remains the 'gold standard' in neonatal anesthesia for inguinal herniorrhaphy but its short duration impedes its usefulness. We previously demonstrated that clonidine prolongs neonatal SA without immediate side effects. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of 124 infants undergoing herniorrhaphy under SA with bupivacaine and clonidine. Two cohorts, term (n = 57) and former preterm (n = 67) infants, were evaluated and compared with regard to episodes of apnea, desaturation, and bradycardia within 24 h of SA. Results: In both groups, postoperative desaturation episodes were unchanged after SA, compared with the 12 preoperative hours, despite significantly increased apnea (P < 0.003 and <0.011 respectively). Transient bradycardias occurred in former preterm infants (P < 0.014): they spontaneously resolved in all cases. Mean arterial pressure did not vary during the study. Upper sensory level of SA, sedation on entering the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and duration of stay in the PACU were similar in both groups. Conclusions: The clinical significance of short apneas, recovering spontaneously without desaturation, remains debatable. It is concluded that addition of clonidine to neonatal SA results in acceptable side effects. Side effects must be compared with the potential advantages before future recommendations.  2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Abstract
  Clonidine is effective in treating sevoflurane-induced postanesthesia agitation in children. We conducted a study on 169 children to quantify the risk reduction of clonidine agitation in patients admitted to our day-surgery pediatric clinic. Children were randomly allocated to receive clonidine 2 mug/kg or placebo before general anesthesia with sevoflurane that was also supplemented with a r egional or central block. An observer blinded to the anesthetic technique assessed recovery variables and the presence of agitation. Pain and discomfort scores were significantly decreased in the clonidine group; the incidence of agitation was reduced by 57% (P = 0.029) and the incidence of severe agitation by 67% (P = 0.064). Relative risks for developing agitation and severe agitation were 0.43 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.78) and 0.32 (0.09-1.17), respectively. Clonidine produces a substantial reduction in the risk of post-sevoflurane agitation in children. 2005 by the International Anesthesia Research Society.

Abstract
  We hypothesized that combined femoral-sciatic nerve block (FSNB) offers better analgesia with fewer side effects than intraarticular infiltration (IA) in children undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Thirty-six children undergoing ACL reconstruction were randomized to FSNB or IA. FSNB patients had FSNB with bupivacaine (0.125%)-clonidine (2 mug/kg), whereas IA patients received bupivacaine (0.25%)-clonidine (1 mug/kg)-morphine (5 mg). Postoperatively, analgesia was provided with patient-controlled analgesia and rescue morphine. Patient demographics were similar. FSNB patients required less intraoperative fentanyl (50 +/- 40 mug versus 80 +/- 50 mug P = 0.04). Visual analog scale score for FSNB was smaller than IA in the recovery room (1.8 +/- 3 versus 5.4 +/- 3; P = 0.0002) and during the first 24 h (1.6 +/- 1 versus 2.9 +/- 2; P = 0.01)). FSNB morphine use in the first 18 h was less (7 +/- 13 mg versus 21 +/- 21 mg; P = 0.03). Fewer FSNB patients vomited (11% versus 50%; P = 0.03). IA patients required morphine patient-controlled analgesia sooner. After ACL reconstruction in children, FSNB with bupivacaine-clonidine provides better analgesia with fewer side effects than IA with bupivacaine-clonidine-morphine. 2005 by the International Anesthesia Research Society.

Abstract
  Purpose: We evaluated whether clonidine, when added to bupivacaine, would significantly prolong caudal analgesia and decrease opioid requirements in children undergoing ureteroneocystostomy. Materials and Methods: A total of 35 children 1 to 10 years old undergoing ureteroneocystostomy received a standardized regimen of general anesthesia, and were randomized to receive a preincision caudal block consisting of either 1 ml/kg 0.125% bupivacaine (controls) or 1 ml/kg 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 mug/kg clonidine (treatment group). Caudal solutions also contained 1:400,000 epinephrine. Following the surgical procedure a second caudal block was performed with half of the original dose of medications. Caregivers were blinded to which caudal solution was administered. Postoperative outcome measures included pain scores, morphine requirements, duration of caudal analgesia and sedation scores. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA. Results: The 2 study groups were similar for mean age, weight and length of surgical procedure. Two patients in the control group were excluded because of protocol violation. Intravenous morphine requirements for rescue therapy were 0.02 mg/kg in the postanesthesia care unit and 0.1 mg/kg on postoperative day 1 for the treatment group, compared to 0.05 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, for controls (p <0.05). Mean interval from anesthesia finish time to first administered dose of morphine was 8.0 hours for the treatment group and 3.9 hours for controls (p = 0.01). Five of 18 patients in the clonidine-bupivacaine group received no postoperative morphine, compared to 1 of 15 in the bupivacaine group. No patient had development of hemodynamic instability, respiratory depression or sedation requiring treatment. Conclusions: The addition of clonidine to bupivacaine significantly increases the duration of caudal analgesia and decreases postoperative morphine requirements in children undergoing ureteroneocystostomy.

Abstract
  Background: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we compared the efficacy of 0.125% bupivacaine and epinephrine 1 : 200 000 with and without clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> for 'single shot' pediatric caudal analgesia. Methods: Thirty ASA I and II children, ages 2-8 years, undergoing outpatient surgical procedures below the umbilicus received 1 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.125% bupivacaine with fresh epinephrine 1 : 200 000 and clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> (group-C) or 1 mlkg <sup>-1</sup> 0.125% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 : 200 000 (group-NC). All patients received a standardized general anesthetic (induction with 67% N <sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> and sevoflurane followed by isoflurane maintenance). Primary outcome measures were time to first rescue analgesic and number of patients requiring rescue analgesic at 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after caudal placement. Secondary outcome measures included: extubation times, Objective Pain Scale (OPS) scores, sedation scores, time in postanesthesia care unit (PACU), discharge time, number of analgesic doses given in 24 h following caudal blockade, and adverse effects (vomiting, hypotension, and bradycardia). Results: There were no differences in demographics, investigated parameters, or adverse effects between groups. Conclusions: We found that the addition of clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.125% bupivacaine with fresh epinephrine 1 : 200 000 for caudal analgesia did not significantly delay the time to first rescue analgesic or decrease the overall need for rescue analgesics in children 2-8 years undergoing surgical procedures below the umbilicus.  2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Abstract
  Introduction: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common problem with no simple solution. This review highlights factors that are known to increase the risk of PONV. It examines the various data on pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods that have been used to prevent PONV. Methods: Peer-reviewed journals on the subject were covered. Conclusion: Patient, surgical and anaesthetic factors increase the risk of PONV. While patient and surgical factors are understandably difficult to control, a multimodal approach involving both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions has been successfully adopted to reduce the incidence of PONV. Various factors have been identified to categorise patients into different profiles to determine their risk of PONV. Perioperative strategies can then be targeted at these patient groups.

Abstract
  Background: Clonidine is a useful premedicant for pediatric anesthesia. The drug has potential for ventilatory depression. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of clonidine premedication on the ventilatory response to hypercapnia during sevoflurane anesthesia using the carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub>) steady state method. Methods: Sixty children (3-13 yr) were assigned to receive clonidine 4 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> or placebo. Anesthesia was maintained with spontaneous breathing and 2% sevoflurane. Minute ventilation (VE), respiratory rate (RR), endtidal CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (P<sub>E</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), and arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were measured with a facemask tightly fitted before and during 7% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. Results: Compared with placebo, oral clonidine failed to reduce VE volume before CO<sub>2</sub> loading under general anesthesia with 2% sevoflurane. Inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub> increased VE. Oral clonidine did not attenuate the increase in VE induced by hypercapnic challenge under sevoflurane anesthesia. There were no differences in RR, P <sub>E</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, or SpO2 between the placebo and clonidine groups before and during CO<sub>2</sub> loading. Conclusion: These data suggest that oral clonidine is a suitable premedication for sevoflurane anesthesia under spontaneous breathing conditions in children.

Abstract
  Background: Clonidine administration in the setting of paediatric anaesthesia is associated with a number of desirable effects, e.g. preoperative sedation, analgesia and reduced anaesthetic requirements. The aim of the current study was to compare postoperative outcome variables using a prospective, randomized, double-blind design after premedication with clonidine or midazolam. Methods: One hundred paediatric ASA physical status 1 patients (age 1-11 year) scheduled for adeno-tonsillectomy were assigned to receive rectal premedication with midazolam (300 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> and atropine 40 mug kg<sup>-1</sup>; group M, n = 52) or clonidine (5 mug kg<sup>-1 and</sup> atropine 40 mug kg<sup>-1</sup>; group C, n = 48) prior to a standardized sevoflurane anaesthetic. The incidence of immediate postoperative pain (0-2h), as assessed by repeated Objective Pain Scale (OPS) scores, was chosen as the primary end-point of the study. Degree of sedation (modified Vancouver sedation scale 0-3), occurrence of postoperative vomiting (POV), and incidence of shivering and immediate postoperative confusion were registered as secondary end-points. After hospital discharge parents were instructed to continue the evaluation of pain, sedation, POV and sleep pattern during a 24-h period. Parents were also asked for their preference concerning the postoperative behaviour of their child (calm, sedated vs. alert, active). Results: In the early postoperative period patients in the clonidine group had a significantly lower sum of 5 OPS scores (median = 8.0) compared to group M (median = 11.5) (P = 0.011). Administration of clonidine was also associated with a slightly higher sum of sedation scores (median = 13) in the early postoperative period compared to children receiving midazolam (median = 12) (P < 0.001). No episode of shivering was observed in the clonidine group but was present in five of the patients in the midazolam group (P = 0.057). In younger children (<5 years) the incidence of postoperative confusion was lower in the clonidine group (P = 0.001). No difference in the frequencies of POV incidences, degree of postoperative pain, need for analgesics, or sleep pattern during the first 24 postoperative hours could be observed between the groups according to the parental evaluation. Children premedicated with clonidine were more calm and sedated compared to children in the midazolam group (P = 0.024) as judged by their parents. A significant majority of parents (75%; P < 0.001) preferred a calm and sedated child during the first postoperative 24-h period. Conclusion: Rectal premedication with clonidine was associated with a significant reduction of pain in the early post-operative period compared to midazolam and was also associated with moderately increased sedation during the first 24 postoperative hours. The sedative effect of clonidine is in agreement with the unambiguous finding of a parental preference for a calm and sedated child during the first 24 postoperative hours.

Abstract
  Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative analgesia provided by caudal S(+)-ketamine and S(+)-ketamine plus clonidine without local anesthetic. Methods: Forty-four children aged 1-5 years consecutively scheduled for inguinal hernia repair, hydrocele repair or orchidopexy were randomly assigned to receive a caudal injection of either S(+)-ketamine 1 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> (group K) or S(+)-ketamine 0.5 mgkg <sup>-1</sup> plus clonidine 1 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> (group KC). Postoperative analgesia and sedation were evaluated by CHEOPS and Ramsay scale from emergence from general anesthesia for 24 h. Results: No statistical difference was observed between study groups with respect to pain and sedation assessment. A slight trend toward a reduced requirement for rescue analgesia in group KC was observed, although not statistically significant. Conclusions: Caudal S(+)-ketamine 1 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> and S(+)-ketamine 0.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> plus clonidine 1 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> are safe and provide effective postoperative analgesia in children without adverse effects.

Abstract
  Background. This double-blind randomized study was undertaken to assess agitation, Bispectral Index (BIS) and EEG changes during induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane in children premedicated with midazolam or clonidine. Methods. Children were allocated randomly to receive rectal midazolam 0.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (n=20) or oral clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> (n=20) as premedication. Rapid induction of anaesthesia was achieved with inhalation of sevoflurane 8% in nitrous oxide 50%-oxygen 50%. After tracheal intubation, the children's lungs were mechanically ventilated and the inspired sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to achieve an end-tidal fraction of 2.5%. The EEG and BIS were recorded during induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation. The EEG was analysed using spectral analysis at five points: baseline, loss of eyelash reflex, 15 s before the nadir of the BIS (BIS<sub>nadir</sub>), when both pupils returned to the central position (immediately before intubation), and 10 min after intubation. Results. Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). At baseline, EEG rhythms were slower in the clonidine group. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with similar EEG changes in the two groups, with an increase in total spectral power and a shift towards low frequencies; these changes were maximal around the end of the second minute of induction (BIS<sub>nadir</sub>). When the pupils had returned to the central position, fast EEG rhythms increased and BIS was higher than BIS<sub>nadir</sub> (P<0.05). In both groups, agitation was associated with an increase in slow EEG rhythms at BIS<sub>nadir</sub>. Conclusions. Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation during sevoflurane induction. During induction with sevoflurane 8% (oxygen 50%-nitrous oxide 50%), the nadir of the BIS occurred at the end of the second minute of inhalation. Agitation was associated with a more pronounced slowing of the EEG rhythms at BIS<sub>nadir</sub> compared with inductions in which no agitation was observed. The BIS may not follow the depth of anaesthesia during sevoflurane induction in children.  The Board of Management and Trustees of the British Journal of Anaesthesia 2004.

Abstract
  Background. Clonidine is used increasingly in paediatric anaesthetic practice to prolong the duration of action of caudal block with a local anaesthetic agent. Which route of administration of clonidine is the most beneficial remains unknown. We compared the effects of caudal and i.v. clonidine on postoperative analgesia produced by caudal bupivacaine after hypospadias repair. Methods. Forty-six children (ASA I or II) aged 24-104 months received standardized premedication with midazolam, a general anaesthetic and a caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25%, 0.5 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>. The children were randomized in a double-blind fashion to two groups: the i.v. group received clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> i.v. and simultaneously the same volume of saline caudally. The caudal group received clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> caudally and a similar volume of saline i.v. After surgery, all children received acetaminophen 20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> rectally or orally 6-hourly and were given a patient-controlled or nurse-controlled analgesia (PCA/NCA) pump with i.v. morphine (bolus of 25 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> and an 8-min lockout period with no background infusion). Monitoring of scores for pain, sedation, motor block, and postoperative nausea and vomiting was performed by nurses blinded to the study allocations. Time to first activation of the PCA/NCA pump and 0-24 h and 24-48 h morphine consumption were also recorded. Results. Forty-four children completed the study. Age, weight and duration of anaesthesia and surgery were similar in the two groups. The median (range) time to first activation of the PCA/NCA pump was similar in the two groups: 425 (150-1440) min in the i.v. group and 450 (130-1440) min in the caudal group. The number of children not requiring postoperative morphine was four and seven respectively. Morphine consumption during 0-24 h and 24-48 h was similar between groups. Conclusions. The analgesic effect of clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> as an adjunct to caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25%, 0.5 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> is similar whether administered i.v. or caudally.

Abstract
  Emergence agitation is a common side effect of sevoflurane anesthesia in children. Dexmedetomidine, because of its sedative and analgesic properties, might be useful for the management of this adverse effect. We studied the effect of dexmedetomidine on recovery characteristics in 90 children aged 1 to 10 yr scheduled to undergo superficial lower abdominal and genital surgery. After inhaled induction with sevoflurane, patients were randomly assigned to receive saline (Group 1, n = 30), dexmedetomidine 0.15 mug/kg (Group 2, n = 30), or dexmedetomidine 0.30 mug/kg (Group 3, n = 30). After a laryngeal mask airway insertion a caudal block was performed in all patients. Maintenance of anesthesia was with 1% end-tidal sevoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide and spontaneous ventilation. Intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory variables were recorded every 5 min. At the end of anesthesia time to eyes opening (TEO) and characteristics of emergence were recorded. General and intraoperative variables were similar in the 3 groups. The TEO was 7.5 +/- 5.0 min in Group 1, 8.2 +/- 5.0 min in Group 2, and 9.8 +/- 4.0 min in Group 3 (NS). The incidence (95% confidence interval) of agitation was 37% (20%-54%) in Group 1, 17% (4%-30%) in Group 2, and 10% (0%-21%) in Group 3 (P < 0.05). Paired comparisons showed a significant difference for Group 1 versus Group 3 (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval of the difference: 7%-47%). The time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit was similar for the 3 groups. We conclude that a dose of dexmedetomidine 0.3 mug/kg administered after induction of anesthesia reduces the postsevoflurane agitation in children and with no adverse effects.

Abstract
  Spinal anesthesia may reduce the incidence of morbidity that follows general anesthesia in neonates and in former preterm infants. However, bupivacaine alone provides a block too short for complete surgery in up to 40% of the patients. Clonidine lengthens spinal anesthesia in adults and caudal block in children without significant side effects. We conducted a controlled, prospective, dose-ranging study of clonidine in spinal anesthesia in 75 neonates, including 50% of former preterm infants, undergoing elective inguinal herniorrhaphy. Patients were given a spinal anesthetic with either 0.5% plain isobaric bupivacaine (1 mg/kg), or bupivacaine plus 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 mug/kg clonidine. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, Spo<sub>2</sub>, sensory block extension and duration were the main data recorded. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, Spo<sub>2</sub>, and block extension were similar in the five groups. Duration of spinal block increased from 67 (58-82) min in the control group up to 111 (93-125) min in the group receiving 1 mug/kg clonidine (P < 0.003). Transient hypotension occurred more often (P < 0.05), and caffeine was given more often, when 2 mug/kg clonidine was given. We conclude that 1 mug/kg clonidine provides a significant improvement in spinal anesthesia duration in newborns without significant side effects.

Abstract
  Clonidine hydrochloride has been used for pre-anesthetic medication to provide a pre-operative sedation in pediatric surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine the plasma clonidine concentration, which gives satisfactory sedation in pediatric surgery. Sixteen pediatric patients (age: 1-11 years, weight: 9-33 kg) received either 2 or 4 microg/kg of clonidine lollipop before entering the operating room. Plasma clonidine concentrations were determined 120 min after administration of clonidine lollipop. Pre-operative sedation was evaluated by 5-point scoring systems at entering the operating room. The changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were also assessed before and after administration of clonidine lollipop. The patients with satisfactory sedation had higher plasma clonidine concentration than that of the patients with unsatisfactory sedation (0.45+/-0.16 ng/ml vs. 0.26+/-0.16 ng/ml, p<0.05). The clonidine concentrations in the satisfactory group ranged from 0.28 to 0.81 ng/ml. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP and HR) before and after administration of clonidine lollipop in both satisfactory and unsatisfactory sedation groups. Plasma clonidine concentration of 0.3-0.8 ng/ml would be sufficient to produce satisfactory sedation without changes in hemodynamic parameters in pediatric surgery.

Abstract
  Adenoid vegetation is a frequent pathology in children, and adenotomy (AT) is the only method of its treatment. The problem of anesthesia at AT has always remained an acute one: the risk of general anesthesia exceeds manifold the risk of intervention itself. At the same time, the local anesthesia is not always an method, therefore, the authors put the goal to improve it through potentiating. A total of 180 children, aged 3 to 14, were divided into several groups; anesthesia at AT was implemented according to the below described methods and with regard for the age-related doses of preparations: Group 1--a 2% lydocain solution administered endonasally (e/n); Group 2--lydocain plus diazepam solution administered e/n; Group 3--same preparations and 50% metamizol solution administered e/n; Group 4--lydocain, metamizol e/n, and diazepam administered transbuccally, i.e. chewing gum; Group 5--a 4% articain solution and metamizol e/n plus diazepam administered transbuccally; Group 6--the same technique after a preliminary administration of lydocain; Group 7--clonidine, administered transbuccally, was added. The adequacy of anesthesia was evaluated by using the parameters of the vegetative nervous system and hemodynamics. It was demonstrated that the administration of lydocain alone leads to a sharp activation of the sympathoadrenal system; metamizol and diazepam, especially when administered transbuccally, contribute to an enhanced efficiency of anesthesia, while the endonasal administration of articain and metamizol, after a preliminary introduction of lydocain, combined with the transbuccal administration of diazepam and clonidine is the most optimal variant, however, this method can not be acknowledged as an ideal one and needs further improvement.

Abstract
  Study Objective: To investigate the analgesic efficacy and safety of epidural infusion of clonidine in children undergoing major abdominal surgery. Design: Randomized open-label study. Settings: Postoperative anesthetic unit and pediatric ward of a metropolitan hospital. Patients: Forty children aged 0 to 3 years undergoing major abdominal surgery. Interventions: Children were randomly allocated to receive a 24-hour epidural infusion of clonidine 1 mug.mL<sup>-1</sup> at rate of 0.2 mL.kg -1 .h -1 preceded by a bolus of 2 mug.kg -1 (CLON group) or a mixture of clonidine 1 mug.mL -1 and ropivacaine 0.1% at rate of 0.2 mL.kg -1 .h -1. Both groups received intravenous (IV) ketoprofen 2 mg.kg -1 every 8 hours. Breakthrough pain was treated with IV tramadol 1 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>. Measurements: Tramadol requirement, sedation and respiratory and hemodynamic changes were measured. Main Results: Approximately 77% and 59.3% of the CLON and CLON+ROPIV groups, respectively, required no tramadol or only one dose over a 24-hour period. Except for those patients who exhibited frequent coughing during the night (4 and 5 patients in the CLON and CLON+ROPIV groups, respectively), no study patients required an analgesic and all had good sleep quality during the first night. Sedation and decreased systolic blood pressure were observed after the clonidine bolus was given. Conclusions: For children undergoing major abdominal surgery, the addition of epidural infusion of clonidine or clonidine plus ropivacaine to IV ketoprofen provided good analgesia quality for postoperative rest pain.  2003 by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  In the past few years, there have been many changes in ophthalmic anaesthesia. Application of drugs in general anaesthesia with excellent controllability enhances patient safety and allows a more efficient OR-management. Regional anaesthesia is gaining widespread use for ophthalmic surgery, especially topical anaesthesia for cataract surgery. Patients for ophthalmic surgery concomitantly often display high age and a high level of co-morbidity and, therefore, belong to the anaesthesiological risk groups ASA III-IV. Life-threatening adverse events including cardiovascular depression are associated with general and regional anaesthesia. Intervention by anaesthesiologists is frequently required for treatment of hypertension or dysrhythmias, and sedation. Thus, monitored anaesthesia care ("standby") is justified. Drugs applied for regional and general anaesthesia may change intraocular pressure. There are a lot of publications about the impact of anaesthesia on intraocular pressure (IOD), however, few on the effects of anaesthesia on pulsatile ocular blood flow. it has to be kept in mind that the effects of anaesthesia on intraocular pressure and pulsatile ocular blood flow may diverge. To avoid an increase of the IOD, especially during anaesthesia induction, drugs, such as succinylcholin, rocuronium and opiates, in particular remifentanil, can be applied. In addition, the use of the laryngeal mask may be advantageous compared to general anaesthesia associated with laryngoscopic tracheal intubation. The management of patients treated with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, has to be taken on the balance of risks. There are risks not only in continuing therapy, but also in discontinuing it perioperatively. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains a distressing and common problem after strabismus repair in particular in children. The incidence of PONV depends on the type of ophthalmic surgery and drugs applied. To reduce PONV in ophthalmic surgery, application of long-lasting opiates should be avoided, and non-opiate analgesics and, depending on the kind of operation, antiemetic prophylactics are recommended.

Abstract
  Background: Caudal epidural injection with local anaesthetics is a popular regional technique used in infants and children. A disadvantage of caudal blockade is the relatively short duration of postoperative analgesia. Opioids have traditionally been added to increase the duration of analgesia but have been associated with unacceptable side-effects. A number of nonopioid additives have been suggested to increase the duration of analgesia. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized control trials comparing the use of local anaesthetic to local anaesthetic with nonopioid additives for caudal blockade in children. The increase in duration of analgesia and side-effects were compared. Results: The addition of clonidine to the local anaesthetic solution produces an increase in the duration of analgesia following caudal blockade in children (pooled weighted mean difference of 145 min with 95% confidence interval of 132-157 min). Side-effects include sedation and the potential for neonatal respiratory depression. Ketamine and midazolam further increase the duration of analgesia, however, the potential for neurotoxicity remains a concern. Conclusion: The evidence examined shows an increased duration of analgesia with clonidine, ketamine and midazolam. However, we are not convinced that the routine use of these adjuvants in the setting of elective outpatient surgery shows improved patient outcome. It is unclear if the potential for neurotoxicity is outweighed by clinical benefits. Further testing, including large clinical trials, is required before recommending routine use of nonopioid additives for caudal blockade in children.

Abstract
  Background: Morphine is widely used in association with local anaesthetics for postoperative epidural analgesia. There are no data on the prolonged use of clonidine for postoperative analgesia in children. The primary outcome of this randomized, double-blind trial was to compare the incidence of side-effects after epidural infusion of clonidine or morphine, in association with ropivacaine in children. Methods: After institutional approval, 26 children, aged 3-12 years, who were scheduled for abdominal surgery, had an epidural catheter placed after induction of general anaesthesia. Patients were then randomized to two different groups. After an initial bolus of 2.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.25% ropivacaine with either 40 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> morphine (group M, n = 14) or 1 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> clonidine (group C, n = 12), an epidural infusion was started at a rate of 0.4 mlkg<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. The patients in the M group received an infusion of 0.08% ropivacaine with 10 mugml<sup>-1</sup> morphine, those in the group C an infusion of 0.08% ropivacaine with 0.6 mugml<sup>-1</sup> clonidine. Results: The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex and weight. One patient in the C group was excluded for misplacement of the epidural catheter. The incidence of vomiting and pruritus was significantly higher in the M group compared with the C group (64% and 85% versus 0%, respectively). The incidence of pain was significantly higher in the C group compared with the M group (73% versus 29%) as well as the need for rescue analgesia medications. Conclusions: Epidural clonidine is followed by a significantly lower incidence of side-effects. However, its analgesic effects, at least at the doses used in this study, are less potent than those of epidural morphine.

Abstract
  In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated whether clonidine lessened the requirements for isoflurane, fentanyl, and labetalol to provide controlled hypotension in children who underwent oromaxillofacial surgery. We also studied preoperative sedative effects, the hemodynamic response to nasotracheal intubation, and recovery characteristics. Thirty-nine healthy children, aged 10-16 yr, received clonidine 5 mug/kg or placebo on the night before surgery and 90 min before surgery. By self-assessment, children in both groups showed similar anxiety, whereas observers rated clonidine patients as more sedated (P < 0.01). Heart rate during induction remained significantly decreased in clonidine patients compared with placebo patients (P < 0.001), as did arterial blood pressure before induction (P < 0.01) and peak pressure after intubation (P < 0.001). Children who took clonidine required significantly less isoflurane to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of 60 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean isoflurane concentration, clonidine 0.99% versus placebo 1.33; P = 0.0004) and required less fentanyl than placebo patients (P = 0.002). Fewer treatment patients received labetalol (clonidine, n = 3 versus placebo, n = 13; P = 0.004). There was a trend toward faster recovery in the clonidine group, with a shortened recovery room stay (P = 0.03). We conclude that clonidine is a useful adjunct for controlled hypotension in children.

Abstract
  Background: We evaluated the effect of oral clonidine on postoperative vomiting (POV) in children undergoing strabismus surgery. Methods: Eighty ASA physical status I children aged 3-12 years were randomly assigned to one of two groups in a double-blinded manner. One hour before surgery, each patient in the clonidine group (n=40) received clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> in apple juice 0.2 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>, and each of the controls (n=40) received apple juice 0.2 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> only. The protocol for general anesthesia was propofol-sevoflurane in N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub>. A paracetamol suppository was administered in each case to prevent postoperative pain. Patient responses during 0-48 h after anesthesia were recorded as complete (no POV, no antiemetic rescue required), retching, vomiting, or rescue antiemetic. Results: There were no significant differences between the clonidine and control groups regarding the number of patients with complete response (21 vs. 18, respectively) retching (10 vs. 14, respectively), vomiting (19 vs. 22, respectively), or rescue antiemetic (9 vs. 12, respectively) during the first 48 h. Conclusion: Oral premedication with clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> did not reduce the rate of POV in the children undergoing strabismus surgery.  Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 47 (2003).

Abstract
  Background: The adjunctive use of clonidine to local anaesthetics has been reported to enhance analgesia both after spinal and peripheral administration. However, no attempt has been made to compare spinal and peripheral application of clonidine in the same surgical context in order to further explore the mechanism for the analgesic action of clonidine when administered together with local anaesthetics. Methods: Using a prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study design, 40 patients, aged 1-7 years, who were undergoing elective surgery for inguinal hernia repair or orchidopexy, were randomly allocated to receive either a caudal block (group C: n = 20; ropivacaine 0.2%, 1 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> + clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>) or an ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block (group I: n = 20; ropivacaine 0.2%, 0.4 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> + clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>) following the induction of a standardized sevoflurane based anaesthetic. Postoperative analgesia [maximum Objective Pain Scale (OPS) score and requirement for supplemental analgesia] and sedation (three-point scale) were assessed at predetermined intervals during the first 24 h postoperatively. Results: Fourteen children in group I and nine children in group C did not require rescue analgesia (P = 0.17). No difference in maximum OPS scores could be detected between the two study groups. The mean time to full recovery regarding sedation was 149 min and 153 min in groups C and I, respectively. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates a trend for better postoperative analgesia following peripheral administration of clonidine compared with central application. However, the main mechanism for the adjunct analgesic effect of clonidine when administered together with local anaesthetics requires further study.

Abstract
  Objective - To evaluate the effect of intrathecal clonidine in children. Study design - A prospective randomised study. Patients and methods - 45 children, 6 to 15 years old, were randomised in two groups; receiving either 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine or 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine added to clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>. We assessed quality and length of motor and sensory blocks and side effects of clonidine: hypotension, bradycardia and sedation. Results - Clonidine was associated with prolongation of motor block, 190 +/- 42 min vs 150 +/- 35 min (p < 0.01), but the difference was not significant. Postoperative analgesia was longer in clonidine group, 490 +/- 35 min vs 200 +/- 50 min (mean +/- SD), p < 0.001. Clonidine was associated with higher incidence of hypotension 54 vs 36% and bradycardia 30 vs 0%. Conclusion - These data suggest that intrathecal clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> is associated with extending duration of postoperative analgesia but with moderate side effects.  2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Abstract
  Although clonidine has both hypnotic and analgesic actions, the dose relationship for each actions is still unknown in a clinical setting when clonidine is used as a premedication in children. We studied 80 ASA physical status I children (age range, 3-8 yr). Subjects were randomly divided into two groups (minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC]-Awake group, n = 40; MAC-Tetanus group, n = 40). Each patient received one dose of clonidine from 1 to 5 mug/kg orally, 100 min before arrival at the operating room. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air. Before tracheal intubation, end-tidal sevoflurane was decreased stepwise by 0.2% at the start of 1.2%, a verbal command was given to the patients, and MAC-awake was determined in each patient. We also investigated MAC-tetanus, determined with transcutaneous electric tetanic stimulations, after tracheal intubation in each patient by observing the motor response to a transcutaneous electric tetanic stimulus to the ulnar nerve at a sevoflurane concentration decreased stepwise by 0.25% at the start of 2.75%. The initial reduction in MAC-tetanus was not as steep as that in MAC-awake. Clonidine reduced MAC-tetanus by 40% at the maximal dose of 5 mug/kg, whereas MAC-awake was already reduced by 50% at 2 mug/kg. We conclude that separate dose-response relationships for oral clonidine are present regarding the hypnotic and analgesic effects in children undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia.

Abstract
  We performed a prospective randomized double-blinded study to test preservative-free S(+)-ketamine alone or in combination with clonidine for intra- and postoperative caudal blockade in pediatric surgery over a 24-h period. Fifty-three children (1-72 mo) scheduled for inguinal hernia repair were caudally injected with either S(+)-ketamine 1 mg/kg alone (Group K) or with additional clonidine (Group C1 = 1 mug/kg; Group C2 = 2 mug/kg) during sevoflurane anesthesia via a laryngeal mask. Intraoperative monitoring included heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry; postoperative monitoring included a pain discomfort scale and a sedation score. No additional analgesic drugs were required during surgery. The mean duration of postoperative analgesia was 13.3 +/- 9.2 h in Group K, 22.7 +/- 3.5 h in Group C1, and 21.8 +/- 5.2 h in Group C2 (P < 0.0001, Group K versus other groups). Groups C1 and C2 received significantly fewer analgesics in the postoperative period than Group K (15% and 18% vs 63%; P < 0.01). The three groups had similar postoperative sedation scores. We conclude that the combination of S(+)-ketamine 1 mg/kg with clonidine 1 or 2 mug/kg for caudal blockade in children provides excellent analgesia without side effects over a 24-h period.

Abstract
  The effects of clonidine on minimum alveolar concentration for tracheal extubation (MAC-ex) have not been elucidated. Clonidine may lead to prolonged emergence from anesthesia. We investigated the effects of oral clonidine premedication on MAC-ex and examined the emergence properties of sevoflurane in children. Sixty ASA physical status I pediatric patients, aged from 2 to 9 yr, were randomly divided into one of three groups and received placebo, clonidine 2 mug/kg, or clonidine 4 mug/kg (n = 20 each) orally, 100 min before the induction of anesthesia. The induction of anesthesia, tracheal intubation, and maintenance of anesthesia were performed with sevoflurane in air and oxygen. MAC-ex was defined according to the modification of Dixon's up-and-down method, with 0.25% as a step size. In addition, in the Control and 4 mug/kg groups, the time from tracheal extubation to spontaneous eye opening (eye-opening time) and the time from tracheal extubation to leaving the operating room (awakening time) were recorded. MAC-ex for sevoflurane (mean +/- SD) was 1.63% +/- 0.13%, 1.04% +/- 0.26%, and 0.66% +/- 0.09% respectively in the Control group, 2 mug/kg group, and 4 mug/kg group. Significant differences were observed among the three groups. The eye-opening times were 5.7 +/- 3.5 min in the Control group and 5.1 +/- 1.0 min in the 4 mug/kg group. The awakening times were 9.7 +/- 3.7 min in the Control group and 9.2 +/- 3.8 min in the 4 mug/kg group. No significant differences were observed among the groups.

Abstract
  Background and Objectives - Premedication is an anesthetic adjuvant which decreases both perioperative anxiety and the need for high anesthetic concentrations, in addition to producing amnesia and contributing to hemodynamic stability. Midazolam and clonidine are among preanesthetic drugs indicated for children. This study aimed at evaluating whether preanesthetic midazolam or clonidine influences hypnosis in children induced with propofol and alfentanil. Methods - Participated in this study 30 patients aged 2 to 12 years, physical status ASA I, undergoing elective surgeries, who were divided into 3 groups: G1- without premedication, G2 - oral midazolam (0.5 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>), and G3 - oral clonidine (4 pg.kg<sup>-1</sup>), both administered 60 minutes before anesthesia. All patients received alfentanil (30 mug. kg<sup>-1</sup>), propofol (3 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>), and atracurium (0.5 mg, kg<sup>-1</sup>). BIS values were evaluated before anesthesia induction (M1) and after tracheal intubation (M2). Analysis of variance was the statistical method used for age, weight, and height, and profile analysis was used for BIS values, considering significant p < 0.05. Results - In comparing the same moment (M1 or M2) among the three groups there were no significant differences. When comparing the two moments of a same group, M1 values were higher than M2 values in all groups. Conclusions - Midazolam and clonidine premedication have not influenced hypnosis level of propofol and alfentanil in children.

Abstract
  Background: Clonidine is often used to improve the duration and quality of analgesia produced by caudal epidural blockade, although the optimum dose of clonidine with bupivacaine remains uncertain. Methods: We compared the effect of clonidine, 1 and 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>, added to bupivacaine (1.25 mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) with that of bupivacaine alone in 75 male children undergoing elective circumcision. Results: There was a trend towards increasing duration of analgesia with increasing dose of clonidine [group B (bupivacaine) 280.7 (171.6) min, C1 (bupivacaine + clonidine 1 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>) 327.8 (188.3) min and C2 (bupivacaine + clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>) 382.0 (200.6) min], although this difference was not statistically significant. Mean time to arousal from anaesthesia was significantly prolonged with clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> (group C2 21.3 (13-36) min, group C1 14.0 (6-25) min and group B 14.4 (2-32) min. Supplementary analgesic requirements and incidence of adverse effects were low, with no differences between the groups. Conclusions: For paediatric circumcision, under general anaesthesia, the addition of clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> to low volume (0.5 mlkg<sup>-1</sup>) caudal anaesthetics has a limited clinical benefit for children undergoing circumcision.

Abstract
  Background: The aim of the study was to determine whether caudal S-ketamine or clonidine prolonged analgesia together with ropivacaine. Methods: Sixty-three boys, aged 1-5 years, who were undergoing minor surgery, were allocated in order to receive one of three solutions for caudal anaesthesia. Group R received 2 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.2% ropivacaine; group C, 2 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.2% ropivacaine + clonidine 2 mugkg<sup>-1</sup>; and group K, 2 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.2% ropivacaine + S-ketamine 0.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup>. Results: Postoperative analgesia assessed by CHEOPS lasted 701 min in group K (P < 0.05) compared with 492 min in group C and 291 min in group R. There were no significant differences between the groups for incidence of haemodynamic and respiratory alterations, motor block or sedation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that S-ketamine 0.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> when added to 0.2% caudal ropivacaine provides better postoperative analgesia than clonidine without any clinically significant side-effect.

Abstract
  There is no report concerning oral clonidine's effects on epidural lidocaine in children. Therefore, we performed a study to assess the concentrations of plasma lidocaine and its major metabolite (monoethylglycinexylidide [MEGX]) in children receiving continuous thoracic epidural anesthesia after oral clonidine premedication. Ten pediatric patients, aged 1-9 yr, were randomly allocated to the Control or Clonidine 4 mug/kg group (n = 5 each). Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air (FIO<sub>2</sub> 40%). Epidural puncture and tubing were carefully performed at the Th11-12 intervertebral space. An initial dose of 1% lidocaine (5 mg/kg) was injected through a catheter into the epidural space, followed by 2.5 mg.  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup>. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and MEGX were measured at 15 min, 30 min, and every 60 min for 4 h after the initiation of continuous epidural injection. The concentrations of lidocaine and MEGX were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Hemodynamic variables were similar between members of the Control and Clonidine groups during anesthesia. The Clonidine group showed significantly smaller lidocaine concentrations (p < 0.05) and the concentration of MEGX tended to be smaller in the plasma of the Clonidine group for the initial 4 h after the initiation of epidural infusion. In conclusion, oral clonidine preanesthetic medication at a dose of 4 mug/kg decreases plasma lidocaine concentration in children.

Abstract
  Epidurally administered clonidine enhances the quality and duration of postoperative analgesia when it is used as an adjunct to local anesthetics in children. We investigated the dose-response relationship for epidural clonidine when added to a continuous postoperative epidural infusion of ropivacaine. By use of an observer-blinded design, 55 pediatric patients (1-4 yr old) were randomly given a postoperative epidural infusion of plain ropivacaine 0.1% 0.2 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> (Group R), ropivacaine 0.08% 0.16 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> plus clonidine 0.04 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> (Group RC1), ropivacaine 0.08% 0.16 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> plus clonidine 0.08 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> (Group RC2), or ropivacaine 0.08% 0.16 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> plus clonidine 0.12 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> (Group RC3). A clear dose-response relationship could be identified for a continuous infusion of epidural clonidine, with clonidine dosages in the 0.08-0.12 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> range providing improved postoperative analgesia (reduced Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario pain score, increased time to first supplemental analgesic demand, and a reduced total number of doses of supplemental analgesics during the first 48 h after surgery). Analgesia was improved without any signs of increased sedation or other side effects. The adjunct use of epidural clonidine in the dosage range of 0.08-0.12 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup> appears effective and safe for use in children.

Abstract
  Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of caudal midazolam-bupivacaine combination in providing post-operative pain relief in children undergoing genitourinary surgery and to study the occurrence of adverse effects. Subjects and methods: Thirty children, aged 2 to 8 years, scheduled for genitourinary surgery were allocated randomly to receive either 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5 ml/kg (group B; n = 15) or 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5 ml/kg with 50 mug/kg midazolam (group BM; n = 15) by the caudal route immediately after induction of general anesthesia. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the study period. Post-operative pain was assessed at regular intervals for 12 hours using an objective pain score. Analgesia was supplemented whenever the pain score was >= 4. Duration of analgesia, as well as the requirement of additional analgesics, were noted. Results: Lowest pain scores were observed with the addition of midazolam to caudal bupivacaine (p < 0.01). Duration of analgesia was longer in group BM (11 +/- 0.5 h) as compared to group B (7.4 +/- 2.1 hours) (p < 0.05). Fewer children (26.6%) required additional analgesia in the combination group whereas in group B, 60% of the children received analgesic supplements within 6 hours after surgery (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation in both groups. We observed no untoward event in either of the groups. Conclusion: Caudal administration of bupivacaine-midazolam mixture prolongs post-operative analgesia compared to bupivacaine alone without causing any adverse effects.

Abstract
  We evaluated the efficacy of clonidine given orally preoperatively for preventing postoperative vomiting (pov) in children undergoing propofol-nitrous oxide anaesthesia for strabismus surgery. Sixty children, ASA physical status I, aged 2-12 years, received diazepam, 0.4 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> or clonidine 4 mugk<sup>-1</sup> (n = 30 each) orally, in a randomized double-blind manner. These drugs were given 105 min before an inhalational induction of anaesthesia. A complete response, defined as no POV and no need for rescue antiemetic medication, during 0-24 h after anaesthesia was 67% with diazepam and 93% with clonidine, respectively (P = 0.024). No clinically adverse event was observed in any of the groups. In summary, pretreatment with oral clonidine enhances the antiemetic efficacy of propofol for the prevention of POV after paediatric strabismus surgery.

Abstract
  We compared the effects of oral clonidine (4 mug/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) on the preanesthetic sedation and postoperative recovery profile in children during tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. In a double-blinded, double-dummy study design, 134 ASA physical status I-II children aged 4-12 yr were randomized to receive a combination of either clonidine and placebo (Group A), or placebo and midazolam (Group B) at 60-90 min and 30 min, respectively, before the induction of anesthesia. Children in the clonidine group exhibited more intense anxiety on separation and during induction of anesthesia via a mask as measured by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scores. They also had significantly lower mean intraoperative arterial blood pressures, shorter surgery, anesthesia, and emergence times, and a decreased need for supplemental oxygen during recovery compared with the midazolam group. However, the clonidine group had larger postoperative opioid requirements, maximum excitement and pain scores based on the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario scale in the Phase 1 postanesthetic care unit. There were no differences between the two groups in the times to discharge readiness, postoperative emesis, unanticipated hospital admission rates, postdischarge maximum pain scores, and 24 h analgesic requirements. The percentage of parents who were completely satisfied with the child's preoperative experience was significantly higher in the midazolam group. There were no differences in parental satisfaction with the recovery period. We conclude that under the conditions of this study, oral midazolam is superior to oral clonidine as a preanesthetic medication in this patient population.

Abstract
  We conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare the efficacy of preoperative diclofenac, flurbiprofen, and clonidine, given alone, as well as the combination of diclofenac and clonidine, and flurbiprofen and clonidine in controlling postoperative pain in 125 children. The patients (ASA I, 2-12 years) undergoing elective ophthalmological surgery were allocated to one of five groups: rectal diclofenac 2 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> following oral placebo premedication, i.v. flurbiprofen 1 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> following placebo premedication, oral clonidine premedication, rectal diclofenac 2 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> following clonidine, and i.v. flurbiprofen 1 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> following clonidine. The children received clonidine (4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>) or placebo 105 min before anaesthesia. Diclofenac or flurbiprofen was given immediately after induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Postoperative pain was assessed by a blinded observer using a modified objective pain scale (OPS). No opioids were administered throughout the study. Rectal diclofenac 2 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> i.v. flurbiprofen 1 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup>, oral clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> provided similar OPS scores and requirement for supplementary analgesics during 12 h after surgery. Combination of oral clonidine and one of these nonsteroidal analgesics minimized postoperative pain. Our findings suggest that this combined regimen may be a promising prophylactic approach to postoperative pain control in children undergoing ophthalmological surgery.

Abstract
  We examined the relative effects of different doses of oral clonidine on the MAC for endotracheal intubation (MAC(EI)) and the MAC for skin incision (MAC) in children. We studied 90 children (15 in each group) (age range 2-8 yr, weight 10-27 kg, height 89-124 cm) who received one of three preanaesthetic medications: placebo (control), oral clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup>, or oral clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> 100 min before anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air without i.v. anesthetics and neuromuscular relaxants. The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was kept constant for >= 15 min before tracheal intubation or skin incision. MACs were determined using Dixon's 'up-and-down method'. Mean (SD) MAC(EI)s of sevoflurane were 2.9 (0.1) %, 2.5 (0.1) % and 1.9 (0.1) % (P<0.05), and MACs were 2.3 (0.1) %, 1.8 (0.1) % and 1.3 (0.1) % (P<0.05), respectively, in control, clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> and clonidine 4 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> groups. The MAC(EI)s and MACs decreased dose-dependently. The MAC(EI)/MAC ratio (1.4) was not affected by clonidine.

Abstract
  Background: Caudal epidural anesthesia is often used as an adjunct to general anesthesia and for postoperative pain relief in children. In anesthetized children, epinephrine and isoproterenol are reliable indicators to detect accidental intravascular injection of a test dose. Oral clonidine, a useful premedicant in pediatric anesthesia, modifies hemodynamic responses to sympathomimetics, including catecholamines. The aim of the current study was to determine whether oral clonidine premedication alters the efficacy of a simulated intravascular test dose containing epinephrine or isoproterenol in sevoflurane-anesthetized children. Methods: One hundred twenty children (aged 1-7 yr) were randomly divided into six groups; control-saline, control-epinephrine, control-isoproterenol, clonidine-saline, clonidine-epinephrine, and clonidine-isoproterenol. The three clonidine groups received oral clonidine 4 mg/kg as premedication, whereas the three control groups did not receive any premedication. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane at a level of 1.2 minimum alveolar concentration. After hemodynamics were stable, 0.1 ml/kg of 1% lidocaine containing epinephrine 0.5 mg/kg or isoproterenol 75 ng/kg was intravenously given to the two epinephrine or isoproterenol groups, respectively, to simulate intravascular injection of a test dose. The saline groups received saline alone instead of the test dose. Heart rate, blood pressure, and T-wave amplitude of electrocardiogram were recorded before and after administration of study drugs for subsequent analysis. Results: Test solution containing epinephrine increased heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and T-wave amplitude. Oral clonidine had no effect on elevation of these variables in response to epinephrine. The isoproterenol-containing test dose produced a prominent increase in heart rate and a less pronounced increase in systolic blood pressure and T-wave amplitude. Oral clonidine also failed to modify isoproterenol-induced hemodynamic and T-wave changes. Calculated sensitivity and specificity of epinephrine or isoproterenol were all 100% based on a new heart rate criterion (positive if >= 10 beats/min) and were unaltered by oral clonidine premedication. Conclusions: Epinephrine or isoproterenol is a reliable marker to detect accidental intravascular injection of a test dose with 100% sensitivity and specificity based on a new heart rate criterion in sevoflurane-anesthetized children. These data suggest that cacy of a simulated epidural test dose containing epinephrine or isoproterenol.

Abstract
  Sevoflurane is frequently used as a rapidly acting drug for the induction of anesthesia. We investigated the awakening concentration (MAC-awake) of sevoflurane in ASA physical status I children (age range 2-10 yr). We also investigated the effects of two different doses of clonidine (2 and 4 mug/kg) on the MAC-awake of sevoflurane. Subjects were randomly divided into three groups and received placebo (n = 24), clonidine 2 mug/kg (n = 17), or clonidine 4 mug/kg (n = 22) orally, 100 min before the induction of anesthesia. Sedation scores were estimated, by using a five-point scale, after entry into the operating room, and anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and balanced nitrogen, without an additional anesthetic. After surgery, end-tidal sevoflurane was decreased stepwise by 0.2% at 15-min intervals, a standardized verbal command was played to the patients, and the MAC-awake was determined. The MAC-awake of sevoflurane alone was 0.78% +/- 0.24% (mean +/- SD), which decreased to 0.36% +/- 0.09% and 0.36% +/- 0.16% (both P <0.0001, compared with the control group) after premedication with the small and large doses of clonidine, respectively. The lack of any dose-response relationship might be explained by a plateau effect.

Abstract
  Background and Objectives - Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic drug with low blood/gas solubility providing fast anesthesia induction and emergence. Its ability to maintain cardiovascular stability makes it ideal for pediatric anesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate hemodynamic stability, consumption of inhalational anesthetics and emergence time in children with and without premedication (midazolam or clonidine) anesthetized with sevoflurane titrated according to BIS monitoring. Methods - Participated in this study 30 patients aged 2 to 12 years, physical status ASA I, undergoing elective surgeries who were divided into 3 groups: G1 - without premedication, G2 - 0.5 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> oral midazolam, G3 - 4 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup> oral clonidine 60 minutes before surgery. All patients received 30 mug.kg<sup>-1</sup> alfentanil, 3 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol, 0.5 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> atracurium, sevoflurane in different concentrations monitored by BIS (values close to 60) and N<sub>2</sub>O in a non rebreathing system. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, expired sevoflurane concentration (EC), sevoflurane consumption (ml.min<sup>-1</sup>) and emergence time were evaluated. Emergence time was defined as time elapsed between the end of anesthesia and patients' spontaneous movements trying to extubate themselves, crying and opening eyes and mouth. Results - There were no differences among groups as to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, EC, sevoflurane consumption and emergence time. Heart rate was lower in G3 group. Conclusions - Sevoflurane has provided hemodynamic stability. Premedication with clonidine and midazolam did not influence emergence time, inhaled anesthetic consumption or maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane. Anesthesia duration has also not influenced emergence time. Hypnosis monitoring was important for balancing anesthetic levels and this might have been responsible for the similarity of emergence times for all studied groups.

Abstract
  Background: Adding clonidine to weak ropivacaine solutions (<0.2%) could potentially enhance analgesia as well as further reduce the risk for unwanted motor blockade. The aim of the present study was to compare the postoperative pain-relieving quality of a ropivacaine 0.1%-clonidine mixture to that of plain ropivacaine 0.2% following caudal administration in children. Methods: In a prospective, observer-blinded fashion, 40 ASA 1 paediatric patients undergoing subumbilical surgery were randomly allocated to receive a caudal injection of either plain ropiVacaine 0.2% (1 ml/kg) (R0.2) or a mixture of ropivacaine 0.1% with clonidine 2 mug/kg (1 ml/kg) (R0.1C). Objective pain scale score and need for supplemental analgesia were used to evaluate analgesia during the first 24 h postoperatively. Residual postoperative sedation was also assessed. Results: A significantly higher number of patients in the R0.1C group (18/20) could be managed without supplemental analgesia during the first 24 h postoperatively compared to the R0.2 group (11/20) (P = 0.034). Both the degree and the duration of postoperative sedation was similar in both groups. No signs of postoperative motor blockade were observed. Conclusions: The combination of clonidine (2 mug/kg) and ropivacaine 0.1% is associated with an improved quality of postoperative analgesia compared to plain 0.2% ropivacaine. The improved analgesic quality of the clonidine-ropivacaine mixture is achieved without causing any significant degree of postoperative sedation. (C) Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 44 (2000).

Abstract
  This study was designed to evaluate the effects of diazepam and clonidine orally given preoperatively on cardiovascular responses to tracheal extubation in children. Fifty children, ASA physical status I, aged 4-10 years, undergoing minor elective surgery (inguinal hernia, phimosis) received orally, in a randomized, double-blind manner, diazepam 0.4 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> or clonidine 4 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> (n = 25 of each). These drugs were administered 105 min before an inhalational induction of anaesthesia. The same standard general anaesthetic technique was employed throughout. The maximum changes in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were less in patients who had received clonidine than in those who had received diazepam (HR, 12 vs 24; SBP, 14 vs 26; DBP, 9 vs 16; mean, P < 0.05). In conclusion, compared to diazepam given orally, pretreatment with oral clonidine attenuates haemodynamic changes associated with tracheal extubation in children.

Abstract
  We have determined if tracheal intubation causes an increase in neuropeptide Y (NPY), a marker of major adrenergic activation, and investigated if rectal premedication with clonidine 2.5 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> might be capable of attenuating the stress response to tracheal intubation compared with midazolam 300 mug kg<sup>-1</sup>, in 20 paediatric patients (1-9 yr). Prospective randomization was performed in a double-blind manner. After induction of anaesthesia with 1% isoflurane, tracheal intubation was performed, and norepinephrine, NPY concentrations and haemodynamic variables were recorded. Tracheal intubation did not increase NPY plasma concentrations, despite transient increases in norepinephrine concentrations, heart rate and arterial pressure. There was no significant difference between the two groups. We conclude that the adrenergic stress reaction in response to tracheal intubation in children was short-lived and of limited magnitude, as indicated by the lack of NPY release.

Abstract
  Background and Objectives. A double-blind study was conducted to assess the efficacy and the side effects of a low dose of clonidine added to an epidural injection of bupivacaine and epinephrine, with or without sufentanil. Methods. One hundred healthy parturients (ASA 1) were randomly allocated into four groups according to the type of epidural analgesia administered. The bupivacaine/epinephrine (BE) group received a 10-mL standard injection of bupivacaine (B) 1.25 mg/mL and epinephrine (E) 1.25 mug/mL. In the bupivacaine/epinephrine/sufentanil (BES) group, 7.5 mug sufentanil (S) was added to the BE mixture. For the bupivacaine/epinephrine/clonidine (BEC) group, 50 mug clonidine (C) was added to the BE mixture, whereas for the bupivacaine/epinephrine/sufentanil/clonidine (BESC) group, both sufentanil and clonidine were added to BE. Fetal heart rate was monitored by continuous cardiotocography. Duration of analgesia, method of delivery, and neonatal outcome (measured using APGAR score, peripheral oxygen saturation, and neurologic adaptive capacity score) and side effects of clonidine were observed. The parturients were routinely asked for their global appreciation of the epidural analgesia technique by visual analog score, 2 hours postpartum. Results. The overall quality and duration of analgesia were superior in the BESC group compared with the other groups, as was the global appreciation by the parturient. The frequency of side effects in the clonidine groups was comparable, with the exception of hypotension and sedation. Hypotension was easily treated by fluids or ephedrine and caused no fetal distress. The level of sedation was mild, and all parturients aroused immediately after verbal commands. Conclusion. The addition of a low dose of clonidine to an epidural injection of bupivacaine with epinephrine and sufentanil provides better analgesia during labor, while keeping the side effects minimal and of minor clinical importance.

Abstract
  In a prospective, double-blind, controlled, randomized study, the psychomotor functions and sedation were assessed after premedication with diazepam and clonidine in children. Forty children in the age-group of 5-8 years, undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were studied. Twenty children (group 1) received oral clonidine 4 mug/kg, and 20 children (group 2) received oral diazepam 0.2 mg/kg, 120 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Sedation and psychomotor functions were assessed in both groups, before and after 60-90 minutes of administration of premedication. The results of the study showed that mean sedation score in group 1 was 8 +/- 1.07, and 9 +/- 0.64 in group 2. On intergroup comparison the sedation was found to be comparatively better in group 2 than group 1 (p < 0.05). The performance of psychomotor functions decreased after premedication in both the groups as compared to that before premedication (p < 0.05). The psychomotor functions were depressed more in diazepam group than in the clonidine group (p < 0.05). Thus, it is concluded that clonidine produces good sedation and causes less effect on psychomotor functions and therefore can be used for premedication in children.

Abstract
  Background: Oral clonidine may influence plasma glucose and lipid homeostasis by modulating endocrinologic responses to surgical stress. The effect of oral clonidine premedication on plasma glucose and lipid homeostasis associated with exogenous glucose infusion were investigated in children undergoing minor surgery. Methods: Otherwise healthy children (n, 120; aged 3-13 yr) were assigned randomly to six groups according to the glucose concentration of the intravenous solution (0%, 2%, or 5%, at a rate of 6 ml  kg<sup>-1</sup>  h<sup>-1</sup>) and the preoperative medications (4 mug/kg clonidine or placebo given 100 min before anesthesia) they were to receive. The plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acid, ketone bodies, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol were determined. Results: Infusion of 5% glucose caused hyperglycemia (mean glucose concentration >200 mg/dl) in six children receiving placebo and two receiving clonidine. Although the mean plasma glucose concentration increased in three placebo groups, it was unchanged and the plasma concentrations of total ketone bodies and nonesterified fatty acid were increased in children receiving clonidine and glucose-free solution. The plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol levels in children receiving placebo increased in response to surgery. Clonidine attenuated the increase in catecholamines and cortisol. Conclusions: Oral clonidine premedication attenuated the hyperglycemic response, probably by inhibiting the surgical stress-induced release of catecholamines and cortisol. Infusion of 2% of glucose maintained plasma glucose concentrations within physiologic ranges in children receiving clonidine.

Abstract
  We investigated the sedative and possible analgesic effects of clonidine and compared with midazolam after rectal administration in pediatric patients. Fourty children (ASA grade I, 2-10 years old) undergoing inguinal hernia were designed randomly to receive either clonidine 2.5 mug/kg (n=20) or midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (n=20) 30 minutes before the induction of anaesthesia . Children's level of sedation and degree of acceptance of mask application during induction of anaesthesia were assessed by an anaesthetist unaware of the used drug, whereas postoperative level of pain was assessed by the parent using the Rating Scale. Rectal administration of 2.5 mu/kg clonidine in children didn't produce efficacious and analgesia when compared with 0.5 mg/kg midazolam.

Abstract
  In adults, clonidine when added to bupivacaine, results in no detectable respiratory depressant effect except when carbon dioxide challenge is performed. However, to date no investigations have quantified this in children. Twenty-four children (nine months to seven years) were randomized in a double-blind study into two groups. After induction, a caudal block was performed with 1 ml  kg<sup>-1</sup> 0.25% bupivacaine. Clonidine 1 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> was added in the clonidine group, and 1 ml normal saline in the placebo group. Patients were monitored in the recovery room for three h from arrival to discharge with continuous pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, a trancutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> tension (tcPCO<sub>2</sub>) every 15 min, and a four point sedation score every 30 min. Mean tcPCO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory rate values were not different between the two groups. Apnoea and desaturation less than 97% were not observed. The sedation score decreased with time in both groups, and the score time interval was significantly higher in the clonidine group (P<0.05). All the patients left the recovery room with a sedation score of 1, excepting four in the clonidine group with a sedation score of 2. Clonidine 1 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> with 0.25% bupivacaine mixture in caudal analgesia in children did not induce an increase in tcPCO<sub>2</sub> despite prolonged sedation.

Abstract
  Background: Sevoflurane is a useful anesthetic for inhalational induction in children because of its low solubility in blood and relatively nonpungent odor. Clonidine has sedative and anxiolytic properties and reduces the requirement for inhalation agents. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) also decreases the requirement of inhaled anesthetics, but the effect is variable. The minimum alveolar concentration for tracheal incubation (MAC(n)) of sevoflurane was assessed with and without N<sub>2</sub>O and clonidine premedication. Methods: Seventy-two patients, aged 3-11 yr, were assigned to one of six groups (n = 12 each). They received one of three preanesthetic medications (two groups for each premedication): placebo (control), 2 mug/kg oral clonidine or 4 mug/kg oral clonidine. In one group of each premedication, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in oxygen; in the other group, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in the presence of 60% N<sub>2</sub>O. Each concentration of sevoflurane at which tracheal intubation was attempted was predetermined according to Dixon's up-and-down method and held constant for at least 20 min before the trial Results: The MAC(n) of sevoflurane in the absence of N<sub>2</sub>O (mean +/- SEM) was 3.2 +/- 0.2%, 2.5 +/- 0.1%, and 1.9 +/- 0.2% in the control, 2-mug/kg clonidine, and 4-mug/kg clonidine groups, respectively. Nitrous oxide (60%) decreased the MAC(n) of sevoflurane by 26%, 24%, and 27% in the control, 2-mug/kg clonidine, and 4-mug/kg clonidine groups. Conclusions: Oral clonidine premedication decreased the MAC(n) of sevoflurane. Nitrous oxide also decreased the MAC(n). The combination of clonidine and N<sub>2</sub>O lessened the MAC(n) of sevoflurane more than did either drug alone.

Abstract
  Background. Clonidine produces analgesia by actions on alpha<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors and enhances both sensory and motor blockade from epidural injection of local anaesthetics. Low-dose clonidine has been used so far for caudal injection in children. Our aim was to study the perioperative effects of high-dose caudal clonidine when added to low concentration of bupivacaine for combined epidural and general anaesthesia in children. Methods. After induction of general anaesthesia caudal block was performed either with 1 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> bupivacaine 0.175% with the addition of clonidine 5 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> (n=20), or with 1 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> bupivacaine 0.175% (n=20). The intraoperative anaesthetic requirements, the perioperative haemodynamic effects, respiratory rate, sedation score, postoperative pain scores and side effects were assessed by a blinded observer. A patient-controlled analgesia system was used for postoperative pain relief. The quality of postoperative pain relief was assessed using Smiley's pain analogue scale. Results. Intraoperative haemodynamic responses did not differ between the groups. However, during emergence from general anaesthesia children in the clonidine group had significantly lower heart rates and blood pressures compared to children in the control group. In addition, heart rates and blood pressures were also lower in the clonidine group in the early postoperative period (P<0.05). Postoperative analgesia was significantly better in the clonidine group as evidenced by the total number of requests (3 vs 12, P<0.05) and the total amount of tramadol (20.5 mg vs 72.8 mg, P<0.05) administered. The duration of the caudal analgesia was significantly longer in the clonidine group (20.9+/-7.4 h vs 14.4+/-10.9 h, P<0.05). Conclusion. Our results suggest that caudal clonidine 5 mugkg<sup>-1</sup> enhances and prolongs caudal blockade with bupivacaine 0.175% in children. It also blocks sympathoadrenergic responses during emergence from anaesthesia. Sedation and cardiovascular effects are observed up to 3 h into the postoperative period.

Abstract
  The effects of clonidine or midazolam premedication on hemodynamic responses induced by induction of anaesthesia and intubation, and on the duration of extubation were investigated in children receiving propofol infusion. Thirty children, ASA physical status I or II, aged 3 month- 12 year were studied. All children received 0.03 mg/kg atropin orally and were pretreated with an anesthetic cream (EMLA) 60 minutes before operation. In Group I clonidine 2.5 mug/kg and in Group II midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were given rectally 30 minutes before operation. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and vecuronium and maintained with propofol infusion. There were no statistically significant differences in systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure just after the induction and intubation between the two groups (p>0.05). Heart rate was higher in Group II than Group I after intubation (p<0.05). Although extubation duration was longer in group II, premedication with midazolam and clonidine appears to be safe and reliable technique during propofol infusion for pediatric patients.

Abstract
  In a prospective, double-blind, controlled study the efficacy of clonidine was assessed in children, with respect to sedation, intubation response, and recovery. Fifty children, aged 4-12 years, undergoing general anesthesia were studied. Twenty-five children (group I) received oral diazepam 0.2 mg/kg and another 25 children (group II) received oral clonidine 3 mug/kg, 90-120 minutes before induction of anesthesia. The level of sedation, hemodynamic changes to laryngoscopy and intubation, the recovery from anesthesia were noted and compared between the groups. Clonidine 3 mug/kg produced sedation comparable to diazepam 0.2 mg/kg (p > 0.1). There was significant (p > 0.01) attenuation of hemodynamic intubation response with clonidine. The recovery with clonidine was not delayed (p < 0.01). Clinically significant hypotension and bradycardia were not observed in any of the patients. We conclude that clonidine 3 mug/kg produces sedation comparable to diazepam 0.2 mg/kg and also attenuates the intubation response without increasing the incidence of complications.

Abstract
  The beneficial perioperative effects of the alpha-2 agonist clonidine have recently been verified in paediatric patients, and the pharmacokinetics have been found to be similar to what has been reported in adults. In a previous study we found that 2.5 mug/kg of clonidine causes a significant reduction in blood pressure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if even lower doses of clonidine are associated with dose dependent or plasma-dependent haemodynamic changes. In a prospective, single, blind, controlled clinical trial, 24 paediatric patients (age range: 13-78 months) were randomised into three groups: control, intravenous clonidine 0.625 mug/kg and intravenous clonidine 1.25 mug/kg respectively. Non-invasive blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at 8-min intervals for 30 min. Plasma concentrations of clonidine were analysed at 15 and 30 min post-injection. A decrease in MABP compared to baseline values was observed in all groups. A significantly greater reduction in blood pressure was seen in all groups receiving clonidine compared to control. In conclusion, low doses of clonidine (0.625 and 1.25 mug/kg) were found capable of causing a blood pressure reduction compared to control. We could not establish a plasma concentration dependent blood pressure effect. The observed blood pressure reductions caused by clonidine were of moderate magnitude. No effect on heart rate was observed, a finding which most likely is explained by the inclusion of atropine in the premedication.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Oral clonidine given as a premedicant in adults has been shown to reduce intraoperative inhalation anaesthetic requirements and provide perioperative haemodynamic stability. We conducted the current study to ascertain whether or not these beneficial effects of clonidine can be reproduced in children. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 60 children (ASA I) aged 5-11 yr, received placebo (control), 2 micrograms kg-1 clonidine, or 4 micrograms kg-1 clonidine orally 105 min before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with halothane, nitrous oxide in oxygen via mask and maintained with halothane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. The halothane concentration was titrated to the concentration required to maintain haemodynamic stability (defined as 20% of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR)) for maintenance of anaesthesia. The end-tidal concentration of halothane was monitored throughout anaesthesia. On completion of surgery, nitrous oxide and halothane were discontinued. Following confirmation of recovery from anaesthesia and muscle relaxation, the endotracheal tube was removed. RESULTS: Higher inspired concentrations of halothane (%) were required in the control and 2 micrograms kg-1 clonidine-treated groups (mean SD: 1.1 +/- 0.2 and 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively) than in the 4 micrograms kg-1 clonidine-treated group (0.6 +/- 0.1) for haemodynamic stability (P < 0.05). Clonidine, 4 micrograms kg-1, significantly reduced the intraoperative lability (coefficient of variation) of systolic and diastolic BP and HR compared with the other two regimens. CONCLUSION: Oral clonidine premedication at a dose of 4 micrograms kg-1 provided intraoperative haemodynamic stability and reduced anaesthetic requirements in children. However, we are unable to extrapolate these observations to younger children and infants.

Abstract
  Anesthesiologists must be sensitive to the emotional and physical needs of their pediatric surgical patients. It is critically important to spend enough time with the patient and his or her family before surgery to formulate the anesthetic plan least likely to produce emotional stress, physical discomfort, and dangerous pharmacologic and physiologic side effects. Preoperative preparation may or may not include medication, especially if nonpharmacologic methods are skillfully employed. Ideally, all perioperative medical and nursing personnel should present a unified approach to presurgical pediatric patients and offer consistent information in an honest and supportive manner. With careful planning and sensitivity anesthesiologists can continue to enhance the quality of the pediatric surgical patient's entire perioperative experience.

Abstract
  Clonidine is an effective preanesthetic medication in children, providing a preoperative sedative effect. The analgesic properties of the drug have been well documented in adults. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of oral clonidine given preoperatively on postoperative pain in children undergoing minor surgery. In a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, 90 children aged 5-12 yr undergoing elective ophthalmic, urologic, and otologic surgery received placebo (control), clonidine 2 mug/kg, or clonidine 4 mug/kg. These drugs were administered 105 rain before the estimated time of induction of anesthesia and followed by treatment with oral atropine 0.03 mg/kg 60 min before anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Postoperative pain was assessed by a blinded observer using an objective pain scale (OPS). Clonidine 4 mug/kg provided lower OPS (highest) scores during 12 h after surgery and reduced requirement for postoperative supplementary analgesic (diclofenac suppository) compared with the other two regimens. These data suggest that oral clonidine premedication (4 mug/kg) is a possible approach to facilitating postoperative analgesia in children undergoing minor surgery.

Abstract
  Sixty boys, aged 1-10 yr, undergoing orchidopexy were allocated randomly to receive one of three solutions for caudal extradural injection. Group A received 0.25% bupivacaine 1 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> with adrenaline 5 mug ml<sup>-1</sup> (1/200 000), group C received 0.25% bupivacaine 1 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> with clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> and group K received 0.25% bupivacaine 1 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> with ketamine 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Postoperative pain was assessed using a modified objective pain score and analgesia was administered if this score exceeded 4. The median duration of caudal analgesia was 12.5 h in group K compared with 5.8 h in group C (P < 0.05) and 3.2 h in group A (P < 0.01). There were no differences between the groups in the incidence of motor block, urinary retention or postoperative sedation.

Abstract
  This is a prospective randomized double-blind trial conducted to determine whether preoperative orally administered clonidine causes or potentiates postoperative vomiting in 140 children (3-12 yr) undergoing strabismus surgery. They were all in-patients and classified randomly into four groups (n = 35 each); placebo (control), diazepam 0.4 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup>, clonidine 2 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>, and clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>. These agents were administered 93-112 min (mean: 100 min) before the anticipated time of induction of anaesthesia. All children received inhalational anaesthesia with halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Muscle relaxation in all patients was obtained with vecuronium and residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with neostigmine and atropine before tracheal extubation. Diclofenac suppository was prescribed to prevent postoperative pain. No opioids or postoperative antiemetics were administered. All children remained in hospital for two days postoperatively. The incidence and freguency of vomiting were compared in the groups with Kruskall-Wallis Rank test. Clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> caused a lower incidence and frequency of vomiting than did placebo and diazepam (incidence and frequency: 11% and 1.37% and 3, and 34% and 2 in clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>, placebo, and diazepam, respectively; P < 0.05 for clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> vs placebo and diazepam). However, low-dose clonidine was ineffective. These data suggest that preanaesthetic medication with clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> may be useful for preventing emesis following strabismus surgery. This property of clonidine indicates that it may be superior to other sedative premedicants suck as diazepam and midazolam.

Abstract
  We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to examine (1) whether plasma catecholamine (CA) concentrations increased in response to tracheal intubation in children, and (2) the effects of clonidine on the CA responses. Sixty children (ASA physical status I) aged 7-13 yr were allocated to one of three groups (n = 20 for each group): diazepam 0.4 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> (active control), clonidine 2 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup>, or clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> po. These agents were administered 105 min before induction of anaesthesia followed by oral atropine 0.03 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> given 60 min before anaesthesia which was induced with thiamylal 5 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup> and tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.2 mg  kg<sup>-1</sup>. Laryngoscopy, lasting 30 sec, was attempted two minutes after administration of the induction agents. Serial values for blood pressure, heart rate, and venous plasma CA concentrations were compared among the three groups and with the respective preinduction measurements. Children receiving diazepam or clonidine 2 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> showed remarkable increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, and plasma CA concentrations in response to tracheal intubation (P < 0.05). The increases were similar for the two regimens. These haemodynamic and CA changes were smaller in children receiving clonidine 4 mug  kg<sup>-1</sup> (P < 0.05). The haemodynamic responses were positively correlated with the CA responses. These findings indicate that tracheal intubation following rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in children provokes a reflex increase in sympathetic activity characterized by increased plasma CA concentrations, and that attenuation of the cardiovascular changes with a high oral dose of clonidine may be due to suppression of the increase in sympathetic activity evoked by the intubation.

Abstract
  Background: Clonidine, which is known to have analgesic and sedative properties, has recently been shown to be an effective preanesthetic medication in children. The drug may cause side effects, including bradycardia and hypotension. This study was conducted to evaluate the ability of intravenous atropine to increase the heart rate (HR) in awake children receiving clonidine preanesthetic medication. Methods: We studied 96 otherwise healthy children, 8-13 yr old, undergoing minor surgery. They received, at random, oral clonidine 2 or 4 mug  kg <sup>1</sup> or placebo 105 min before scheduled induction of anesthesia. Part I (n 48, 16 per group): When hemodynamic parameters after insertion of a venous catheter had been confirmed to be stable, atropine was administered in incremental doses of 2.5, 2.5, and 5 mug  kg <sup>1</sup> every 2 min. The HR and blood pressure were recorded at 1-min intervals. Part II (n 48, 16 per group): After the recording of baseline hemodynamic values, successive doses of atropine (5 mug  kg <sup>1</sup> every 2 min, to 40 mug  kg <sup>1</sup>), were administered until HR increased by 20 beats  min <sup>1</sup>. The HR and blood pressure were recorded at 1-man intervals. Results: Part I: The increases in HR in response to a cumulative dose of atropine 10 mug  kg <sup>1</sup> were 33 +/- 3%, 16 +/- 3%, and 8 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) in children receiving placebo, clonidine 2 mug  kg <sup>1</sup>, and clonidine 4 mug  kg <sup>1</sup>, respectively (P < 0.05). Part II: The HR in the control group increased by more than 20 beats  min <sup>1</sup> in response to atropine 20 mug  kg <sup>1</sup> or less. In two patients in the clonidine 4 mug  kg <sup>1</sup> group, HR did not increase by 20 beats  min <sup>1</sup> even after 40 mug  kg <sup>-1</sup> of atropine. Conclusions: Oral clonidine premeditation (4 mug  kg <sup>1</sup>) blunted the increase in HR after intravenous atropine in awake children, although clonidine 2 mug  kg <sup>1</sup> did not. A larger dose of atropine was required tn increase the HR by 20 beats  min <sup>1</sup> in children receiving the premedicant in the larger dose.

Abstract
  Clonidine is a useful drug to give preoperatively because it produces anxiolysis, sedation, and hemodynamic stability, and reduces intravenous and volatile anesthetic requirements. Several premedicants, including midazolam and diazepam, have been shown to reduce the induction dose of intravenous anesthetics, such as thiopental, ketamine, or propofol. A randomized, double- blind controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effect of premedication with oral clonidine on thiamylal requirement for the induction of anesthesia and on associated hemodynamic changes in children. Sixty children (ASA grades I-II, 7-12 yr old) were assigned randomly to receive one of three treatments (n = 20, for each group): placebo (control), clonidine 2 mug/kg, or clonidine 4 mug/kg 105 min before the induction of anesthesia. Thiamylal was injected at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 15 s until loss of the eyelash reflex and the dose was recorded. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded every minute from the beginning of injection of thiamylal for 5 min. Significant decreases in thiamylal dose were observed in patients receiving clonidine. The induction dose of thiamylal (mean +/- SD) was 5.4 +/- 0.9, 4.5 +/- 1.1, and 3.4 +/- 0.9 mg/kg for patients receiving placebo, clonidine 2 mug/kg, and clonidine 4 mug/kg, respectively (P < 0.05). Systolic BP decreased by 6.8%, 5.6%, and 6.6% and HR increased by 5.7%, 4.8%, and 4.1% after administration of thiamylal in the control (placebo) group and the clonidine 2 mug/kg and clonidine 4 mug/kg groups, respectively (P > 0.05). Premedication with oral clonidine reduced the dose of intravenous thiamylal required for the induction of anesthesia in children.

Abstract
  In a randomized, double-blind study in children undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery, we have assessed the clinical value of combining clonidine with bupivacaine for caudal analgesia. Forty-six children, aged 1-10 yr, were allocated randomly to two equal groups to receive 0.25% bupivacaine 1 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> combined with either normal saline 1 ml (group A) or clonidine 2 mug kg<sup>-1</sup> in normal saline 1 ml (group B). Mean (SD) duration of caudal analgesia for groups A and B were 5.2 (1.2) h and 9.8 (2.1) h, respectively (P<0.0001). Group B required significantly less supplementary analgesia after operation (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects between the two groups. The longer duration of sedation in group B (9.1 (2.5) h) resulted partly from the sedative effect of clonidine and partly from the longer duration of analgesia provided by clonidine. We conclude that, when added to bupivacaine, clonidine improves the efficacy of caudal analgesia in children.

Abstract
  Background: Clonidine, an alpha<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist, has been shown to be effective as a preanesthetic medication in adults. The current study was designed to investigate the efficacy of two doses of oral clonidine as a premedicant preceding oral atropine in children. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 105 children, aged 4-12 yr, undergoing elective ophthalmologic surgery received 0.4 mg/kg diazepam, 2 mug/kg clonidine, or 4 mug/kg clonidine orally. These agents mixed with apple juice were administered 105 min before the estimated time of induction of anesthesia, and were followed by treatment with 0.03 mg/kg oral atropine 60 min before anesthesia. A blinded observer noted the children's level of sedation, quality of separation from parents, and degree of acceptance of mask application during inhalation of nitrous oxide used for establishment of venous access. Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg/kg thlamylal, and tracheal intubation was facilitated with 0.2 mg/kg vecuronium. Hemodynamic changes after tracheal intubation were compared among the three groups. Results: Clonidine produced significant sedation, and the effect was dose related. Clonidine, 4 mug/kg, provided better quality of separation and acceptance of mask than the two other regimens. This dose of clonidine attenuated the increases in blood pressure and heart rate after tracheal intubation. No clinically significant perioperative hypotension or bradycardia was observed. Conclusions: These data indicate that, even in pediatric surgery, the combination of 4 mug/kg and 0.03 mg/kg oral clonidine is an effective premedication. However, the safety and optimal dose of clonidine in this setting remain to be determined.

Abstract
  Clonidine produces analgesia via a non-opioid mechanism and it may be used as an interesting adjuvant to local anaesthetics and opioids in obstetric analgesia. To examine the effects of the addition of clonidine to bolus injections of bupivacaine, adrenaline and sufentanil, we enrolled 50 women receiving extradural analgesia for vaginal delivery into a double-blind study. They were allocated randomly to two groups: group A received a 10-ml extradural solution of bupivacaine 12.5 mg combined with adrenaline 25 mug and sufentanil 10 mug; group B received the same solution with clonidine 30 mug. Each patient was allowed two subsequent injections of the chosen solution. Subsequently, if still in the first stage of labour, analgesia was augmented with additional 10-ml injections of bupivacaine 12.5 mg with adrenaline 25 mug, without sufentanil or clonidine. The latter solution was used for perineal analgesia in group A; clonidine 30 mug was added in group B. During the first and second stages of labour, there was no difference between the two groups in duration of analgesia after the first injection (142 min in group A; 127 min in group B), number of injections (1.8 in group A; 1.9 in group B) and the total bupivacaine requirements (33.9 mg in group A; 34 mg in group B). The quality of analgesia was evaluated as very good in both groups (23/25 in group A; 24/25 in group B). The degree of motor block or the frequency of other side effects were not enhanced by clonidine. Analgesia was greater for episiotomy in group B (15/20 in group A; 21/21 in group B) (P < 0.05). Within the limits of this study, the total dose of extradural clonidine 90 mug appeared to be safe for the mother and the child.
